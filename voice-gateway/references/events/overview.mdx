You can [collect event data](/ai/agents/analyze/collecting-data) for further analysis in [Insights](/ai/agents/analyze/insights). To collect this data, you can access Voice Gateway events in the [Output Transformer](/ai/for-developers/transformers/output-transformer) and the `input.data.event` Input object, except for the `CALL_COMPLETED` event. You can't access `CALL_COMPLETED` in `input.data.event` since the Input object's content is deleted after `CALL_COMPLETED` occurs. Alternatively, you can register the `CALL_COMPLETED` events by enabling the `CALL_COMPLETED` toggle in the Call Events section of the [Voice Gateway Endpoint](/ai/agents/deploy/endpoint-reference/voice-gateway) configuration.

The Output Transformer is executed after processing the flow. For example, if you receive the `CALL_COMPLETED` event, write some metrics in the transformer via HTTP request.

You can also use a **Lookup** Node with the [Call Event Status](/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/logic/lookup) type for reusing these events, streamlining call handling and improving efficiency.
