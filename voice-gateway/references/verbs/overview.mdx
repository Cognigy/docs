To create a voice AI Agent,
you need to build a Flow on the Cognigy.AI side using [Voice Nodes](/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/voice/voice-gateway/overview).
These Nodes provide the basic verbs required for your voice agent. If you require additional verbs that are not available in the Voice Nodes, you can add them using a [Code Node](#custom-verbs-in-code-nodes). 
For incoming calls, you can use Voice Nodes and a Code Node. However, for outgoing calls, you must specify all parameters in the call request body, as described in the [Advanced Configuration Request](/voice-gateway/creating-outbound-calls#advanced-configuration-request) section.

## List of Verbs

The table presents the list of supported verbs.

## Custom Verbs in Code Nodes

The example shows how a [Code Node](/ai/for-developers/code/overview) can send a customized [`dial`](/voice-gateway/references/verbs/dial) verb with an Answering Machine Detection
(`amd`) action hook.

```js
api.output(null, {
    "_cognigy": {
        "_voice-gateway2": {
            "json": {
                "verb": "dial",
                "actionHook": "dial",
                "callerId": "+49XXXXXXXXXXX",
                "target": [
                    {
                        "type": "phone",
                        "number": "+49XXXXXXXXXXX",
                    }
                ],
                "amd": {
                    "actionHook": "amd",
                    "recognizer": {
                        "vendor": "microsoft",
                        "language": "en-US",
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
})
```
