SIP trunk providers offer services that allow connecting phone systems to the public telephone network using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) over an IP network. These providers enable to make and receive calls over the Internet, providing flexibility, cost savings, and scalability compared to traditional phone lines.

Cognigy Voice Gateway can support any SIP trunk provider. Additionally, Cognigy Voice Gateway includes preinstalled configurations for the following SIP trunk providers:

- Voxbone
- Twilio
- Simwood
- TelecomsXChange
- NiCE CXone<sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup>

You can select a SIP trunk provider when setting up a [carrier](/voice-gateway/webapp/carriers) in the Voice Gateway Self-Service Portal. The carrier settings will be prefilled with standard values for the selected provider, which you can further customize based on your specific requirements.
