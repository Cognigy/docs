_Users_ allow you to manage members in your account: create new members, edit, or delete existing ones. You can assign roles to users to control access, manage permissions, and define what actions they can perform within Cognigy Voice Gateway.

## Scopes

A _Scope_ defines a user role and the permissions associated with it. The scope determines what actions a user can perform, which resources they can access, and what areas of the system they can manage. Assigning the appropriate scope ensures users have the correct level of access while maintaining security and operational control.

Depending on the Cognigy Voice Gateway installation, members can have the following scopes:

- [Account](#account)
- [Service Provider](#service-provider)
- [Admin](#admin)

### Account

<a href="/release-notes/4.62"><Badge className="version-badge" color="blue">Updated in 4.62</Badge></a>

This scope includes basic operations with Voice Gateway entities, such as creating, editing, and deleting entities. 

It also allows for editing user profiles, carriers, and speech services that belong to users with the Account scope.

Users with the Account scope can be authorized in the Voice Gateway Self-Service Portal via their Cognigy.AI user credentials.
To activate this option, you need to activate the **Set up Voice Gateway**
button in the **User menu > Admin Center** of the Cognigy.AI UI.
Go to **User Menu > Admin Center > Access Control** and add a `voice-gatewayUser` role for selected users.

### Service Provider

This scope is only available for on-premises Cognigy Voice Gateway installations. 

It includes all the operations in the Account scope and the ability to edit user profiles, carriers, and speech services that belong to users with either the Account scope or the Service Provider scope. 

Additionally, users with the Service Provider scope can create, edit, and delete users with the Account and Service Provider scopes, and they can generate API keys.

### Admin

This scope is only available for on-premises Cognigy Voice Gateway installations. 

It includes all operations in the Account and Service Provider scopes, allowing for performing all operations in the Voice Gateway. 

Additionally, Admins can create, edit, and delete users with the Account, Service Provider, and Admin scopes. They can also generate API keys and change password requirements.
