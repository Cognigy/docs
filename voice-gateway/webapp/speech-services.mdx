**Speech services** integrate Speech-to-Text (STT) or Text-to-Speech (TTS) vendors in the Voice Gateway Self-Service Portal. To ensure the AI Agent gets a voice, a speech service must be selected within the [Application](/voice-gateway/webapp/applications). By connecting with a speech vendor of your choice, you can select between multiple voices, genders, accents, and languages. You can add multiple speech vendors to the Voice Gateway Self-Service Portal, or install multiple configurations of one speech vendor, to quickly switch between different setups.

Voice Gateway supports the following speech vendor configurations:

- [Cloud-based](#cloud-based-speech-services)
- [On-premises](#on-premises-speech-services)

For the list of supported vendors and their Speech-To-Text and Text-To-Speech capabilities, see the [TTS and STT Vendors](/voice-gateway/references/tts-and-stt-vendors) reference.

If you need to create multiple speech services from the same vendor, use the **Label** field to create a unique speech service.

After creating a speech service, you can edit or delete it.

Users with an Account scope can only edit speech services they have created, as well as speech services created by other users with the same scope. They can still use and view speech services shared by Service providers or Admins.

## Add Custom Speech Vendors

If the desired vendor is not included in the list of preinstalled vendors,
or if you want to modify the configuration of an existing one, you can add a custom vendor.

Before adding a vendor to the Voice Gateway, you need to create it.
To do this, use the [custom-speech-example](https://github.com/Cognigy/custom-speech-example/tree/main) template on GitHub.
Using the same template, you can customize vendors that are provided in it as examples, such as Google, AssemblyAI, and Vosk, or create a new one.
After you have created the custom provider, deploy it on a server,
for example, in the AWS Cloud, then copy the address of the custom provider for use in the Voice Gateway.

To add a custom speech vendor, follow these steps:

1. In the left-side menu of the Voice Gateway Self-Service Portal, select **Speech**.
2. On the **Speech services** page, click **Add speech service**.
3. On the **Add a speech service** page, select **Custom** from the **Vendor** list.
4. In the **Name** field, specify a unique name for your provider. You need to reuse this name in the Node configuration.
5. From the **Account** list, select a specific account or leave the **All accounts** value if you want that custom speech provider will be available for all available accounts.
6. In the **Label** field, create a label only if you need to create multiple speech services from the same vendor. Then, use the label in your [application](/voice-gateway/webapp/applications#add-additional-tts-and-stt-vendor) to specify which service to use.
7. Activate the **Use for text-to-speech** setting to use this provider as a TTS vendor. Enter the TTS HTTP URL of the server where your custom vendor is deployed. 
8. Activate the **Use for speech-to-text** setting to use this provider as an STT vendor. Enter the STT websocket URL of the server where your custom vendor is deployed.
9. In the **Authentication Token** field, enter the key that you get from your TTS or STT vendor to set up a connection. 
10. Click **Save**.

To start using your speech provider,
you need to specify the provider name in the **Custom** parameter of the relevant Nodes,
such as [Set Session Config](/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/voice/voice-gateway/set-session-config),
[Say](/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/basic/say), [Question](/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/basic/question) or [Optional Question](/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/basic/optional-question),
or [Session Speech Parameters Config](/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/voice/generic/session-speech-parameters-config).

<sup id="footnote1">1</sup>: The EU environment is isolated, and custom voices aren't available in it by default. To use custom voices in the EU environment, you need to share them from non-isolated environments. For more information on sharing resources from non-isolated environments, read the [respective instructions](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/product-guides/administration/data-residency#how-do-i-share-a-pvc-from-a-non-isolated-environment-to-an-isolated-environment) in the ElevenLabs documentation.
