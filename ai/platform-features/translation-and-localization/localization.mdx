Cognigy.AI offers a robust localization feature for easy customization and content reuse. You can configure multiple Locales and add localized content to your Flow. Alternatively, you can use [machine translation to automatically translate content](/ai/platform-features/translation-and-localization/auto-translation). If one Locale doesn't have configured content, Cognigy.AI automatically falls back to another Locale.

## Restrictions

- You can't change the primary Locale after you've selected it.

## Limitations

- The maximum number of Locales per Project is 10.

## How to Use

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="API">
        You can view, create, edit, and delete Locales using the [Cognigy.AI API](https://api-trial.cognigy.ai/openapi#tag--Locales-v2.0).

### Localize Flows

You can localize [Nodes](/ai/agents/develop/nodes/overview) and [Intents](/ai/platform-features/nlu/intents/overview) in the [Flow editor](/ai/agents/develop/projects-and-flows/editor) after selecting a Locale in the top bar.
