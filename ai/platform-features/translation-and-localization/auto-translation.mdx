Cognigy.AI has integrated _Automatic Translation_ capabilities to streamline the process of customizing Flows and Intents for various Locales. These capabilities are helpful for users who need multilingual support for voice and text AI Agents without the need for manual translations.

## Key Features

- **Freedom of Language Choice**. You have the flexibility to choose your preferred translation language.
- **Supervised or Automatic Translation**. You can trigger the translation manually or automatically, depending on your needs.
- **Voice-Ready Translation**. Cognigy.AI's translation capabilities are equipped to handle all modes, making them voice-ready and adaptable to various communication methods.

## Prerequisites

- Add a [machine translation provider](#configure-machine-translation-providers).
- Add a [Locale](#how-to-use-automatic-translation).

## Restrictions

- For [Intents](#machine-translation-for-flow-localization), machine translation doesn't match the [Slots](/ai/platform-features/nlu/intents/overview) you set for your primary Locale to the Keyphrases in the localized Example Sentences. After performing an Intent or Multi-Intent localization, check and fix the [Slot annotation](/ai/platform-features/nlu/intents/annotations) in the localized Example Sentences.

### Machine Translation for Flow Localization

You can automatically translate [Nodes](/ai/agents/develop/nodes/overview) and [Intents](/ai/platform-features/nlu/intents/overview) in the [Flow editor](/ai/agents/develop/projects-and-flows/editor). To do so, select a Locale in the top bar, go to the Node editor or the **NLU** tab, and click **Add Localization**.
