      In Cognigy.AI, the Reject Intent feature designed to intentionally prevent
      the NLU model from recognizing certain user inputs that are outside the
      intended scope of the AI Agent.
---

The *Reject Intent* feature allows you to block the NLU model from recognizing user inputs that aren't relevant to your AI Agent.
This approach helps AI Agents focus on in-context questions, ignoring irrelevant ones.

## Key Benefits

- **Enhanced focus on core capabilities**. By filtering out irrelevant inputs, your AI Agent can prioritize the tasks it's designed to handle.
- **Improved user experience**. By avoiding responses to out-of-scope queries, you can prevent confusion and keep conversations on track.

## Restrictions

- This feature may struggle with complex or varied off-topic inputs unless paired with [standard Intents](/ai/platform-features/nlu/intents/overview) or [Intent rules](/ai/platform-features/nlu/intents/rules).

## Limitations

- You can create only one reject Intent per Flow.

## How to Use

To use this feature, create a reject Intent and add several example sentences.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Create a Reject Intent">

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="GUI">

        To create a reject Intent, go to **NLU > Intents** your Flow.
        Under the **Create Intent** button, click ![vertical-ellipsis](https://docs.cognigy.com/_assets/icons/black-and-white/vertical-ellipsis.svg) and select **Create 'Reject Intent'**. 
      
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="API">

        You can create a reject Intent using the [Cognigy.AI API /v2.0/flows/{flowId}/intents](https://api-trial.cognigy.ai/openapi#post-/v2.0/flows/-flowId-/intents) request and specifying the `"isRejectIntent": true` parameter.

      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Add Example Sentences">

    On the **Reject Intent** page, add a list of example sentences representing the user inputs you want the NLU model to ignore.
    Save changes and click **Build Model** to apply them. You can also generate these sentences [using Generative AI](/ai/agents/develop/gen-ai-and-llms/generative-ai).
    Similar to standard Intents, you can also add [annotations](/ai/platform-features/nlu/intents/annotations) to each example sentence.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How to Test

Test your feature in the Interaction Panel:

1. Open the Interaction Panel and activate **Debug Mode**. 
2. Enter examples matching your reject Intent sentences to verify if they're ignored by the NLU model. If the NLU model catches them, the Input object will have the following format:

    ```json
     "nlu": {
        "intentMapperResults": {
          ...
          "intentPath": [
            "Reject Intent"
          ],
          "scores": [
            {
              "id": "f0db738b-e1c3-4841-a6d9-490e082b8ec5",
              "name": "Reject Intent",
              "score": 1,
             ... 
            }
          ]
        },
    ```

## Example

Imagine your AI Agent is designed to assist drivers with parking-related queries.
A user asks `Where can I find a park nearby?` intending a green space rather than a parking lot.
By including similar reject Intent sentences, you can train the AI Agent to filter out these requests, ensuring it stays focused on parking assistance.
