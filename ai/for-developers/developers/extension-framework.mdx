The _Extension Framework_ provides developers with the ability to create custom Extensions with Extension Nodes and Knowledge Connectors that go beyond the default and marketplace Nodes.

## Custom Extensions

Custom Extensions can offer:

- Extension Nodes that perform new actions, integrate with external systems, process data, and improve conversational scenarios for users.
- Knowledge Connectors that offer new integration with external knowledge databases and improve RAG capabilities.

## Development Requirements

Developing custom Extensions requires:

- Knowledge of TypeScript/JavaScript.
- Installation of Node.js and NPM packages.

## Getting Started

To start implementing a custom Extension, refer to the [Extension's npm package Readme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cognigy/extension-tools/v/0.16.5-rc2).
