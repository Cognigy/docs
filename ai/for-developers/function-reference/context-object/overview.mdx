The _Context Object_ functions are used to manage the [Context object](/ai/agents/develop/ai-agent-memory/context) of a conversation. You can add, get, remove, or delete data from the Context object, as well as reset it to its default state.

## [`addToContext`](/ai/for-developers/function-reference/context-object/addToContext)

**Syntax:** `addToContext(key, value)`

Adds a value to the Context object.

## [`getContext`](/ai/for-developers/function-reference/context-object/getContext)

**Syntax:** `getContext(key)`

Retrieves the value associated with a given key in the Context object.

## [`deleteContext`](/ai/for-developers/function-reference/context-object/deleteContext)

**Syntax:** `deleteContext(key)`

Removes a value from the Context object.

## [`removeFromContext`](/ai/for-developers/function-reference/context-object/removeFromContext)

**Syntax:** `removeFromContext(key, value, mode)`

Removes data from the Context object: either a key-value entry or a specific value within an array stored under that key.

## [`resetContext`](/ai/for-developers/function-reference/context-object/resetContext)

**Syntax:** `resetContext()`

Resets the Context object to the default Context of the active Flow. This action removes all custom keys and values that were added during the conversation.
