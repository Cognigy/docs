These are functions that don’t belong to any specific group. They let you evaluate conditions, mark conversation goals as complete, and extract data from user input using regex.

## [`evaluateRule`](/ai/for-developers/function-reference/other/evaluateRule)

**Syntax**

`evaluateRule(rule)`

Evaluates a condition based on a rule configuration that follows the `left`, `operator`, `right` pattern. This function works similarly to the If Node.

## [`completeGoal`](/ai/for-developers/function-reference/other/completeGoal)

**Syntax**

`completeGoal(goal)`

Marks a goal as `completed` for the conversation.

## [`setRegexSlot`](/ai/for-developers/function-reference/other/setRegexSlot)

**Syntax**

`setRegexSlot(params)`

Extracts Slots from user inputs using a regular expression and writes them to `input.slots`. This function is used by the [Regex Slot Filler](/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/ai/regex-slot-filler) Node.
