This page lists the public IP addresses used by NiCE Cognigy and NiCE CXOne Shared SaaS installations to perform SIP signaling or send outbound requests.

Both Cognigy.AI and Cognigy Voice Gateway use multiple public _IP addresses_ per installation. _IP addresses_ in this document refer to the network addresses used for outbound requests (Cognigy.AI) and SIP signaling (Voice Gateway).

If you implement IP whitelisting on your API servers for added security, inform Cognigy Support or your Customer Success Manager.

<Note>
   The list of IP addresses may change over time. NiCE Cognigy will promptly notify you of any updates.
</Note>

<Warning>
   The IP addresses for SIP signaling aren't used for transmitting audio data. Separate IP addresses handle audio/media traffic and are subject to change due to automatic scaling, so NiCE Cognigy doesn't provide those addresses. The required IP addresses and ports for audio/media will be negotiated dynamically when establishing calls.
</Warning>
