_My Profile_ lets you manage your user profile, preferences, API keys, and connected accounts.

The **My Profile** page includes:

- [Preferences](#preferences)
- [Global Roles](#global-roles)
- [Login History](#login-history)
- [API Keys](#api-keys)
- [Connected Accounts](#connected-accounts)

## Working with My Profile

Access the **My Profile** page by clicking your user icon in the upper-right corner of the Main page or the bottom-left corner of the Project page.

On the **My Profile** page, you can update preferences, view login history, manage API keys, and more. Click ![vertical-ellipsis](/_assets/icons/black-and-white/vertical-ellipsis.svg) in the upper-right corner to access the extended menu, where you can select the following actions:

- **Edit Profile** — opens the profile editing page where you can update your personal information.
- **Copy Organization ID** — copies the organization ID associated with your user account. This ID is used for Single Sign-On (SSO) and other integrations.
- **Delete Account** — permanently deletes your user profile from Cognigy.AI, including all API keys and connected accounts. This action is irreversible.

### Global Roles

View user's [global roles](/ai/administer/access/admin-center/access-control) that apply across multiple Projects. You can configure more granular roles for each individual Project.

### Login History

View a list of previous login sessions and their location (if available). You can use this information for auditing purposes.

### API Keys

API keys allow third-party services to access Cognigy.AI in the same way a human user would by entering their password to log in to the platform.

API keys inherit the same permissions as the associated user profile, such as Admin, Project Manager, or OData.

API keys provide authorization to perform requests made available via the [Cognigy.AI Open API](/ai/for-developers/developers/api-and-cli) or to return conversation data from the [Cognigy OData Analytics Endpoint](/ai/agents/analyze/odata).

Only users with [global roles](/ai/administer/access/admin-center/access-control) can manage their API keys.
