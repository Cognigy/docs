The _Access Control_ interface provides a user management tool for organizational-level administration.
The interface acts as an Access Control List (ACL), enabling the assignment of specific roles to users.

In the Access Control interface, you can assign global roles only. These roles apply to all Projects within your organization and set basic access rights for all agents the user can access. If you want to assign Project-specific roles, refer to [Members](/ai/administer/access/members).

## Before you Begin

### Explore Global Roles

Global roles are assigned to a user to establish access control across the entire organization. For more granular control within a Project, assign [Project-specific roles](/ai/administer/access/members).

### Check Who Can Access the Access Control Page

Users with `admin` rights have full control over the Admin Center interface. However, users with one of the following roles have access only to the **Access Control** page:

- `projectAdmin` – a [Project role](/ai/administer/access/members#project-roles), read-only access.
- `memberManager` – a [Project role](/ai/administer/access/members#project-roles), read-only access.
- `userManager` – a global role, full access.
- `userDetailsViewer` – a global role, read-only access.
