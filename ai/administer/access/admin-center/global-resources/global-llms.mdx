_Global Large Language Models_ (Global LLMs) are [LLMs](/ai/agents/develop/gen-ai-and-llms/llms) at [organization level](/ai/administer/access/admin-center/global-resources/overview) that you can assign to and share across different Projects in your organization.

## Restrictions

- Global LLMs can't be set as a [default model](/ai/agents/develop/gen-ai-and-llms/other-operations).
- Global LLMs can't be cloned.

        You can view, create, edit, and delete global LLMs in the [Admin Center](/ai/administer/access/admin-center/global-resources/overview) under **Resources > LLMs** as well as copy their Reference ID.

        To assign a global LLM to a Project, go to the global LLM page, click ![assign](/_assets/icons/black-and-white/assign.svg) or ![edit-assign](/_assets/icons/black-and-white/edit-assign.svg) in the **Assigned Projects** section, and select the Project.

        You can also view global LLMs in **Build > LLMs** and edit their settings.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="API">

        You can view, create, delete, and edit global LLMs using the [Cognigy.AI API](https://api-trial.cognigy.ai/openapi#tag--LargeLanguageModels-v2.0). To do so, set the `resourceLevel` parameter to `organisation` in the JSON body.
