_Global Resources_ are Cognigy.AI resources that you can assign to and share across different Projects in your organization. Global resources work similarly to their counterparts at Project level and have a similar [user interface as other resources](/ai/overview/user-interface/resource-pages).

Global resources include:

- [Global Large Language Models](/ai/administer/access/admin-center/global-resources/global-llms)
- [Global Connections](/ai/administer/access/admin-center/global-resources/global-connections)

## Restrictions

- Only users with `admin` [global role](/ai/administer/access/admin-center/access-control) can access global resources.
- You can't export global resources as a [Package](/ai/platform-features/packages) or [Snapshot](/ai/agents/deploy/snapshots).
