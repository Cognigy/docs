The _Members_ interface in a Cognigy.AI Project allows Project admins to assign and manage Project-specific roles. This interface allows fine-grained control over who can create, edit, view, or update different parts of a Project, complementing the [global roles](/ai/administer/access/admin-center/access-control) set in the Access Control.

## Project Roles

Project roles let you control what users can do within a specific Project. To manage permissions across the whole organization, use [global roles](/ai/administer/access/admin-center/access-control).

<Note>
  Project roles assigned to users determine what actions a user can perform in the UI and through API endpoints, ensuring consistent access control across both interfaces.
</Note>

Each permission works as follows:

- **Create** – create a new resource.
- **Read** – view or retrieve the resource and its details.
- **Update** – view and change an existing resource's data or settings.
- **Delete** – permanently remove the resource.

Having full permissions means a user can create, read, update, and delete the resource.
