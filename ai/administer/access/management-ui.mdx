<a href="/release-notes/2026.3"><Badge className="version-badge" color="blue">Updated in 2026.3</Badge></a>

The *Management UI* is a web-based interface for managing system-wide and organization-specific settings in Cognigy.AI.

Use the Management UI to configure users, organizations, quotas, password policies, data privacy settings, expiration values for sensitive data, and system messages.

The Management UI is especially useful for:

- System administrators, particularly in on-premises or dedicated SaaS installations.
- Advanced users who need to manage multiple organizations or adjust global settings.

## Key Features

- **User and Organization Management**. Create, modify, remove users, and add them to specific organizations, which serve as isolated environments within Cognigy.AI.
- **Resource Control through Quotas**. Set specific quotas for organizations to manage resource usage, including user seats, Projects, and messages. Quotas let you prevent overuse and ensure equitable resource allocation.
- **Security and Privacy Settings**. Change password policies and manage data privacy settings, ensuring compliance with security standards and protecting sensitive information through features like data masking and retention policies.
- **Multitenancy and Impersonation Features**. Cognigy.AI supports multitenancy, enabling the management of multiple organizations under one installation, along with the ability to impersonate users for troubleshooting and assistance.

    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="2. Log in to the Management UI">
        To log in to the Management UI instance, you need the following information:

        | **Field**                   | **Description**                                                                                                              |
        |-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | Cognigy.AI Backend Base URL | The base URL must follow this format: `https://api-<your installation domain>`. For example: `https://api-trial.cognigy.ai`. |
        | Service User                | The username provided by your Management UI administrator.                                                                   |
        | Service Password            | The password for the service user account, provided by your Management UI administrator.                                     |
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Manage Organizations

Organizations define the environment for users, Projects, and data in Cognigy.AI. Use the Management UI to create and configure organizations, adjust quotas and policies, and manage data privacy and expiration settings. Each organization has its own limits, users, and settings, allowing for secure and flexible multi-tenant environments.

Each installation includes at least one organization, which is created automatically. This initial organization is named `defaultOrg-xxx`.

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Create an Organization">
        1. In the Management UI, select **Organisations** from the left-side menu, then click ![plus](/_assets/icons/management-ui/plus.svg) in the bottom-right corner.
        2. In the **Create new Organisation** window, fill in the following fields:
            - **Name** – enter the name of the organization.
            - **Business Unit ID** – this field is optional. Enter the Business Unit ID if applicable for NiCE Cognigy billing.
            - **Tenant ID** – this field is optional. If you want users to log in to Cognigy.AI via their NiCE CXone accounts, enter the Tenant ID for your NiCE CXone Mpower instance. This way, users can log in via single sign-on (SSO), so they don't need a separate Cognigy.AI username or password. Each Tenant ID is tied to a single Cognigy.AI organization. When users log in via SSO, they can access only the organization associated with that Tenant ID.<br/>
              Specifying a Tenant ID allows NiCE CXone users to log in to Cognigy.AI under the **Automation** category in the app selector of the NiCE CXone Mpower interface.
              This option is available only if the Cognigy.AI application is activated in NiCE CXone Mpower.
              For more information, refer to the [NiCE CXone Mpower](https://help.nicecxone.com/content/cognigyai/enablecognigyaiandssoaccess.htm#Virtual) documentation.
        3. Click **Create**. The organization will be created with the default settings and appear in the list of organizations.

You can change the user's role later on the [Access Control](/ai/administer/access/admin-center/access-control) page for the organization where the user was added.

        You can add a user with the same email to multiple organizations. For details on how users access each organization, refer to the [Login for Users in Multiple Organizations](/ai/administer/installation/access-to-cognigy-ai#multiple-organizations) page.

        When impersonating a user, you can log in to the system as the selected user without knowing their actual account password.

        To impersonate a user, select a user from the list, then click **Impersonate** in the upper-right corner of the **User Details** page.
        Make sure to log out after you have finished your work.

    <Accordion title="Block User Impersonation">
        To prevent unauthorized access and protect user privacy, blocking impersonation improves security and helps prevent account misuse.

        You can block user impersonation as follows:

        - For SaaS installations, contact [Cognigy technical support](/help/get-help).
        - For dedicated SaaS and on-premises installations, use the `BLOCK_IMPERSONATE_USER_ORG_WHITELIST` feature flag. You can block user impersonation for:
            - **One organization** — enter the `organisationId` in the `BLOCK_IMPERSONATE_USER_ORG_WHITELIST` feature flag.
            - **More than one organization** — enter the `organisationId` values separated by commas, for example, `BLOCK_IMPERSONATE_USER_ORG_WHITELIST=63c6af010aa7a0eadd88edbd,63c6af010aa7a0eadd88edbe`.
            - **All organizations** — set `BLOCK_IMPERSONATE_USER_ORG_WHITELIST=*`.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Other Operations">
        You can also disable or delete a user by selecting them from the user list, clicking ![vertical-ellipsis](/_assets/icons/black-and-white/vertical-ellipsis.svg), and selecting the respective option on the **User Details** page.
    </Accordion>
