_Project Settings_ are a set of configuration options that let you customize how your AI Agents operate. These settings apply to all resources within the Project. However, some settings can be overridden at the Flow level.

In Project settings, you can:

- Define default values for your Project, such as currency, time zone, and thresholds.
- Control analytics and data collection.
- Configure NLU behavior, including Intent recognition, Slot extraction, and confirmation logic.
- Connect your AI Agent to external services such as translation providers and speech providers.
- Select models for Knowledge AI and Generative AI features.
- Configure the Live Agent inbox.

To adjust Project settings, select a Project on the [Main page](/ai/overview/user-interface/main-page), then go to **Manage > Settings**.

The default value is `Cognigy`. If you want to connect to a third-party embedding model provider, refer to [Intent Recognition with External Embedding Model](/ai/platform-features/nlu/external/external-nlu-intent-recognition).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

    | Enable Case-Sensitive Intent Mapping | Allows the Intent Mapper to consider case sensitivity for all Flows. Disable the setting to ignore casing. After changing this setting, retrain all Flows via **Build > Flows > Train all Flows**. If **Train all Flows** isn't available, for version 2026.2 or earlier, set `FEATURE_TRAIN_ALL_PROJECT_FLOWS: "true"` in `values.yaml` for on-premises installations, or upgrade to version 2026.3 for SaaS. Note that case-sensitive mapping isn't supported for English locales (US, Indian, UK, Canadian, Australian), use the universal Locale instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                |

    | Intent Threshold                     | Sets the confidence threshold and reconfirmation threshold:<ul><li>**Confidence Threshold** – the score from which an Intent is considered confirmed if a confirmation sentence is set. The default value is `0.4`.</li><li>**Reconfirmation Threshold** – the lower confidence bound at which an Intent is reconfirmed. The default value is `0.2`.</li></ul> For example, if a user input scores `0.3`, the AI Agent asks for reconfirmation; if the user input scores `0.5`, it will be confirmed automatically. For more information, refer to [Thresholds](/ai/platform-features/nlu/intents/thresholds). The setting can be overridden at the [Flow](/ai/agents/develop/projects-and-flows/overview#settings) level. |
