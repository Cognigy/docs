_Tasks_ let you monitor when specific events occur in a Flow.

To track tasks in a Flow, use a [Complete Task](/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/analytics/complete-task) Node.

Once the Node is triggered,
the task is recorded in the Analytics database and can be monitored in the [Contact Profile](/ai/agents/analyze/contact-profiles),
viewed in Insights [reports](/insights/reports/overview) and [explorers](/insights/explorers/transcript#session-transcript-details), and accessed through the [OData endpoint](/ai/agents/analyze/odata) for further analysis.

For more information, read the [Complete Task Node](/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/analytics/complete-task) article.

## Compatibility Alias to `profile.tasks`

In the [Profile](/ai/agents/develop/ai-agent-memory/profile) object, `profile.goals` has been renamed to `profile.tasks`.
To ensure your existing code still works in Flows, `profile.goals` now functions as a compatibility alias that points to `profile.tasks`. This means you can still use `profile.goals`. Its value is stored in the `profile.tasks` object. Accessing `profile.goals` provides the value from `profile.tasks`, for example:

- When using the `{{ profile.goals }}` or `{{ cp.goals }}` CognigyScript expressions.
- In Code Nodes, Extension Nodes, and Functions.

The `profile.goals` alias is available for existing implementations to maintain continuity. However, for new Flows, use the new `profile.tasks` naming convention in your CognigyScript expressions and code. This approach ensures that your Flows comply with the latest platform standards and best practices.

### Restrictions of the Alias

This compatibility alias for `profile.goals` isn't a standard property of the Profile object.
This alias limits how you can use or inspect it:

- **Property Listing** – `profile.goals` doesn't appear when you list the object's properties, for example, when using `Object.keys(profile)`.
- **JSON Serialization** – `profile.goals` doesn't appear when you turn the Profile object into JSON, for example, when using `JSON.stringify(profile)`.
