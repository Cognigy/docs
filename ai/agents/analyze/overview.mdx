When working on conversational AI projects, keeping track of how your AI and human agents are performing is essential. Cognigy.AI offers a variety of tools that can help you analyze and evaluate your agents' effectiveness. You can use these tools to monitor important metrics, such as:

- Average speed of answer
- Resolution rate
- Customer satisfaction

With this data, you can find areas where your agents may need more training or improvement, and make informed decisions on how to optimize their performance.

## Cognigy Insights

[Cognigy Insights](/ai/agents/analyze/insights) is Cognigy.AI's built-in analytics solution that provides advanced analytics and visualizations for the interactions between end users and both AI and human agents. With Insights, you can view data, track metrics, analyze performance, and export data to use in other business intelligence tools for each [Project](/ai/agents/develop/projects-and-flows/projects).

## OData

Cognigy.AI provides an [OData Analytics Endpoint](/ai/agents/analyze/odata) that lets administrators import agent performance data into external data visualization tools, allowing for the creation of custom dashboards.

## Call Tracing

[Call tracing](/ai/agents/analyze/call-tracing) involves recording calls made by a voice AI Agent using Voice Gateway for debugging purposes. Call tracing helps you troubleshoot issues, identify latency sources, and ensure voice agents function seamlessly.

## Contact Profiles

[Contact Profiles](/ai/agents/analyze/contact-profiles) store user information, and you can access them through Flows and Endpoints. Contact Profiles let you store data persistently and personalize conversations with end users.

## Dashbot

Any Endpoint can be connected to the third-party analytics vendor [Dashbot](/ai/agents/deploy/endpoints/data-protection-and-analytics).
