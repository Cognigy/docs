## What are Agentic AI Agents?

An [Agentic AI Agent](/ai/agents/overview) is advanced conversational intelligence powered by a Large Language Model
(LLM),
designed to operate autonomously while adapting dynamically in real time to context, persona, and instructions.
Unlike traditional intent- or rule-based systems,
these AI Agents go beyond scripted responses â€” demonstrating flexibility,
problem-solving capabilities, and proactive decision-making.

In this guide, you will create a Logistics AI Agent to answer general questions and assist with parcel inquiries.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Up Prerequisites">
    Configure the necessary LLMs for language and embeddings, for example, OpenAI GPT-4o and ada-002, to enable your AI Agent.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Your AI Agent Persona">
    Go to **Build > AI Agents**, set the name, for example, `Peter Parcel`, description, avatar, and speaking style. Optionally, assign knowledge and configure security. Click **Create** to test.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign a Job">
    On the **Jobs** tab, define the job title, for example, `Delivery Manager`, description, and instructions.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Enhance with Knowledge">
    Upload documents in Knowledge AI, then assign the knowledge to your AI Agent in its configuration to improve company-specific responses.
  </Step>
<Step title="Add Tools">
   In the **Tools** section, click **Add Tool > Regular Tool**. Set Tool ID (for example, `track_parcel`) and parameters (for example, `tracking_code`).

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Memory">
    Configure memory settings to personalize interactions and retain user details.
    To configure short-term memory, in the **Memory Handling** section, set **Long-Term Memory Injection** to **Inject full Contact Profile**.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Image Recognition">
    In the **Image Handling** section, activate **Process Images**. Enable **Attachment Upload** in the Webchat v3 Endpoint settings. Ensure a storage provider like AWS or Azure is set.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Explore the Flow">
    Open **Advanced Editor** to view and edit all Nodes controlling AI Agent responses.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy Your AI Agent">
    [Cognigy.AI Endpoints](/ai/agents/deploy/endpoint-reference/overview) allow AI Agents to interact with external users via chat and voice channels.

    Deploy an AI Agent via Webchat:

    1. Go to **Deploy > Endpoints**.
    2. Add a new Endpoint and link it to the Flow.
    3. Click **Open Demo Webchat** to test the AI Agent.
  </Step>
</Steps>
