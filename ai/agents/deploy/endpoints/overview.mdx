_Endpoints_ are connectors between AI Agents and [external systems or platforms](/ai/agents/deploy/endpoint-reference/overview), such as Facebook (Meta) Messenger, Slack, Alexa, and others.

Endpoints support chat and voice conversations in contact centers and integrate with [handover provider](/ai/escalate/handovers) to manage these interactions.

Endpoints convert [channel-specific](/ai/agents/develop/nodes/channels) input and output, including images, galleries, and voice, into the structure of the [Input object](/ai/agents/develop/ai-agent-memory/input). This approach allows the development of platform-agnostic [Flows](/ai/agents/develop/projects-and-flows/overview) that require no modification when you add new channels.

### General Endpoint Settings

For every Endpoint, you have the following basics:

| Setting         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Snapshot        | This setting is optional. Select the [Snapshot](/ai/agents/deploy/snapshots) of the [Project](/ai/agents/develop/projects-and-flows/projects) you want to use.<br/><br/>By default, Endpoints use the [Connections](/ai/platform-features/connections) from the Snapshot. If you select a Snapshot, the [Override Snapshot Connections](#override-snapshot-connections) toggle is displayed under the **Snapshot** list. |
| Locale          | This setting is optional. Select the [Locale](/ai/platform-features/translation-and-localization/localization) for the Endpoint. The Locale list only appears if you've created a Locale beforehand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Flow            | Select the [Flow](/ai/agents/develop/projects-and-flows/overview) to use for the Endpoint.<br/><br/>You can enter manually by clicking **Manual Input** below the Flow list. Click ![jump to Flow](/_assets/icons/black-and-white/jump-to-flow.svg) next to the **Flow** list to open the selected Flow in the Flow editor.                                                                                                                |
| Endpoint URL    | The Endpoint URL serves as the interface to the Endpoint. For most third-party platforms, you need to copy it into the channel's settings to configure the connection to Cognigy.AI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| NLU Connector   | Select the [NLU Connector](/ai/platform-features/nlu/external/nlu-connectors/overview) for the Endpoint. To disable Intent and Slot recognition, select the [No NLU](/ai/platform-features/nlu/external/nlu-connector-reference/no-nlu) option.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Enable Endpoint | Toggle to activate or deactivate the Endpoint. This setting is enabled by default.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

#### Override Snapshot Connections

If you activate the **Override Snapshot Connections** toggle, the Endpoint overrides the [Connections](/ai/platform-features/connections) in the Snapshot with Connections from the Project. If only the Snapshot has a Connection, the Connection isn't overridden. If necessary, you need to update such Connections manually.

To override the Connection of the AI Agent in production, you can:

- Make the necessary changes in a staging environment, create a Snapshot of the same AI Agent, and select the Snapshot in the Endpoint settings. Deactivate the **Override Snapshot Connections** toggle.
- Import Connections from another AI Agent using a [Package](/ai/platform-features/packages). Activate the **Override Snapshot Connections** toggle.

## Specific Endpoint Settings

You can use the following additional settings for the Endpoint configuration:

- [Data Protection & Analytics](/ai/agents/deploy/endpoints/data-protection-and-analytics)
- [Transformer Functions](/ai/for-developers/transformers/overview)
- [Session Management](/ai/agents/deploy/endpoints/session-management)
- [Real-Time Translation Settings](/ai/agents/deploy/endpoints/real-time-translation-settings)
