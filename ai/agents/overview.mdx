## Prerequisites

Before using the Agentic AI feature, you need:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Create an account in one of the LLM Providers">
   - [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/). You need to have a paid account or be a member of an organization that provides you access. Open your OpenAI user profile, copy the existing API Key, or create a new one and copy it. You can also use an [OpenAI-compatible LLM provider](/ai/agents/develop/gen-ai-and-llms/providers/openai-compatible) that supports the OpenAI API.
   - [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/openai-service). You need to have a paid account or be a member of an organization that provides you access. Ask your Azure administrator to provide API Key, resource name, and deployment model name.
   - [Anthropic Claude](https://console.anthropic.com/docs). You need to be a [member of an organization](https://console.anthropic.com/docs/access) that provides you access.
   - [Google Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models/gemini). You need to have a paid account or be a member of an organization that provides you access.
   - [Amazon Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/). You need to have a paid account or be a member of an organization that provides you access.
   - [Mistral AI](https://docs.mistral.ai/). You need to have an account or be a member of an organization that provides you access.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="2. Add two models">
   - A primary model to control the AI Agent, selected from the following providers:
       - `gpt-5-2`, `gpt-5` series models, `gpt-4.1`, `gpt-4.1-mini`, `gpt-4.1-nano`, `gpt-4o`, or `gpt-4o-mini` powered by [OpenAI](/ai/agents/develop/gen-ai-and-llms/providers/openai) or [Azure OpenAI](/ai/agents/develop/gen-ai-and-llms/providers/microsoft-azure-openai). You can also use an OpenAI-compatible model.
       - `claude-haiku-4-5`, `claude-sonnet-4-5`, or `claude-opus-4-0` by [Anthropic](/ai/agents/develop/gen-ai-and-llms/providers/anthropic).
       - `gemini-2.5-pro`, `gemini-2.5-flash`, `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`, `gemini-2.0-flash`, or `gemini-2.0-flash-lite` by [Google Gemini](/ai/agents/develop/gen-ai-and-llms/providers/google-gemini).

### AI Agent Management

_AI Agent Management_ refers to the workspace used to control AI Agents within a Project.
This workspace includes the creation, modification, and deletion of AI Agents.
With AI Agent Management, you can effectively build autonomous AI Agents for specific roles, tasks, and workflows.

#### AI Agent Creation

You can create AI Agents tailored to meet specific business needs.
Designing these AI Agents allows you to handle a wide range of tasks, such as providing customer support, driving sales, automating data analysis, and more.

#### Job Market

You can hire an AI Agent with a ready-made set of skills for a specific task and adapt it to your needs.

The table shows available example AI Agents for hire.

### AI Agents — a New Conversational Paradigm

AI Agents autonomously perform many tasks that in previous conversational AI deployments had to be manually developed, such as intent detection and management, decision-making, entity extraction, and more. All of these tasks are now configured as part of the AI Agent.

#### AI Agent Node

The [AI Agent Node](/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/ai/ai-agent) refers to the use of an AI Agent in the context of a specific job. The AI Agent Node references the AI Agent persona and defines the job name, job description, and job-related instructions and context.

##### Job Instructions

Within the AI Agent Node, you must give clear instructions that guide the AI Agents in performing specific tasks.
For example, you could include instructions for executing an API call, processing data for analysis, performing a sentiment analysis, triggering automated emails, or classifying user queries.

##### Tools

_Tool Actions_ represent specific tasks that an AI Agent can perform. A [tool action](/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/ai/ai-agent#child-nodes) allows the AI Agent to perform a variety of tasks, for example, interact with external services such as an API or to execute several rules-based actions. The full power of Cognigy.AI can be used to configure what happens when a tool action is called.

Along with tool actions, you can use [Model Context Protocol](/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/ai/ai-agent#mcp-tool) (MCP), which boosts tool actions by providing a standardized connection between AI Agents and external services. It allows smooth integration with remote systems like APIs and databases, enabling the AI Agent to perform more complex tasks in a secure and efficient way.

##### Tool Calls

_Tool Calls_ occur when the AI Agent decides to use a tool action and executes the branch underneath the Tool Action Node.

#### Resolve Tool Action Node

The [Resolve Tool Action Node](/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/ai/resolve-tool-action) sends an answer as the response to a tool call to the AI Agent after completing a [tool's action](#tools).

When the AI Agent calls a tool to perform an action, the tool action is executed.
Once the action is completed, the Resolve Tool Action Node sends a response back to the AI Agent,
indicating the result of that action.
This approach helps the AI Agent process and make decisions based on the results of the tools it initiated.

#### AI Agent Handover Node

The [AI Agent Handover Node](/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/ai/ai-agent-handover) enables smooth AI Agent-to-AI Agent handovers, allowing multiple AI Agents to collaborate and take over tasks to efficiently resolve complex customer inquiries.

#### LLM Prompt Node

The [LLM Prompt Node](/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/service/llm-prompt) is an alternative to the AI Agent Node. The updated version of LLM Prompt Node adds support for tools, image generation, and conversation transcripts. Use it with the Load AI Agent Node to fully replicate AI Agent Node behavior.

#### Load AI Agent Node

The [Load AI Agent Node](/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/ai/load-ai-agent) lets you load AI Agent data, such as instructions, name, and knowledge, into the Context or Input object.
This Node allows you to reuse the AI Agent's setup in other Nodes without duplicating configuration steps.

#### Transcript Nodes

AI Agents use the conversation transcript to process conversations, allowing it to reference past interactions for improved decision-making and providing more accurate responses in conversations.

##### Get Transcript Node

The [Get Transcript Node](/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/service/get-transcript) lets receive a real-time conversation transcript and store the result in the Input or Context object.

##### Add Transcript Steps

The [Add Transcript Steps Node](/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/service/add-transcript-steps) lets you add a step for one of the conversation actors to simulate an input or output.
