The _Flow Editor_ is a user interface (UI) where you can see a graphic representation of a [Flow](/ai/agents/develop/projects-and-flows/overview), the _Flow Chart_, and design AI Agents' conversations. In the Flow editor, the Flow consists of Nodes that represent various actions or decision points. The [Nodes](/ai/agents/develop/nodes/overview) are linked to one another by lines that indicate the conversation's path, from the **Start** Node to the **End** Node.

The Flow editor allows for [Collaborative Editing](/ai/agents/develop/projects-and-flows/collab-editing). This means that multiple users can edit the same Flow at the same time.

A green arrow next to a Node indicates the Flow Entrypoint. The Entrypoint is where the AI Agent expects a user entry. The Flow editor highlights the path of the conversation in green. The green path allows you to understand the Flow execution path at each step, depending on the input in the [Interaction Panel](/ai/agents/test/interaction-panel/overview).

## Limitations

- You can add up to 100 Nodes in the Flow editor.
