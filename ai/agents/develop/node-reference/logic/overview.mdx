    title="Add To Context"
    href="/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/logic/add-to-context"
  >
    Use the Add To Context Node to store information in the [Context](/ai/agents/develop/ai-agent-memory/context) object and use this information throughout the session.

  <Card
    title="Execute Flow"
    href="/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/logic/execute-flow"
  >

  <Card
    title="Go To"
    href="/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/logic/go-to"
  >
    Use the Go To Node to switch between Flows or between Nodes.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="If"
    href="/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/logic/if"
  >
    The If Node evaluates a condition statement and triggers either the Then or Else child Nodes.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Interval"
    href="/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/logic/interval"
  >
    Use the Interval Node to add a minimal interval before other Nodes are executed.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Lookup"
    href="/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/logic/lookup"
  >
    The Lookup Node acts as a switch between different options. Based on the input value, the Node executes one of the options.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Once"
    href="/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/logic/once"
  >
    Once Nodes limit the Flow execution after them to once per session, for example, for greetings or database requests.

    title="Remove From Context"
    href="/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/logic/remove-from-context"

  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Set State"
    href="/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/logic/set-state"
  >
    The Set State Node changes the Flow's [State](/ai/agents/test/interaction-panel/state).
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Reset State"
    href="/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/logic/reset-state"
  >
    The Reset State Node resets the Flow's [State](/ai/agents/test/interaction-panel/state).
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Sleep"

  >
    The Sleep Node pauses the Flow execution for a period you define.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Stop and Return"
    href="/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/logic/stop-and-return"
  >
    The Stop and Return Node stops the Flow execution and returns to the Start Node.

    title="Switch Locale"
    href="/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/logic/switch-locale"
