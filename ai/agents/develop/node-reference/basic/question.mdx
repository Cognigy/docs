## Description

A Question Node is used to ask a question that requests specific information from the user. When the Node is triggered, the [Entrypoint](/ai/agents/develop/projects-and-flows/editor) shifts to this Node so that the conversation continues only after the user answers. Also, a new [Input](/ai/agents/develop/ai-agent-memory/input) object is generated.

When a user input is received, it's scored based on natural language understanding (NLU). If an attached Flow has an Intent that scores higher than Intents in the current Flow, the [attached Flow](/ai/platform-features/nlu/attachments) is executed. The Intent scoring occurs before validation of the Question Node is completed.

After the AI Agent asks a question and the user answers, the answer is validated according to its type. If it passes, the answer is valid and stored, and the conversation continues.

<Accordion title="Question Nodes and Intent Execution">
  Question Nodes, by default, are triggered repeatedly until a valid answer is provided. To avoid this behavior, you can use an Optional Question or change the Intent Execution setting.

  <Accordion title="Question Types">

    Question Nodes have a selection of types that determine the validation used before a conversation continues.

    set the LLM provider in the [Settings](/ai/agents/develop/gen-ai-and-llms/generative-ai).
    You can configure the Node to either use the default model defined in the Settings or choose a specific configured LLM.

    | Escalation Action | Selector | Defines what happens when a question step escalates. Select one of the following options: <ul><li> **No Escalation** – no action is taken. This option is selected by default.</li> <li>**Output Message** – sends a message and behaves the same as a Say Node.</li><li>**Skip Question** – skips the question and stores a value under the `result` in the Input object.</li><li> **Go To Node** – jumps to a specific Node and continues from there and behaves as a Go To Node.</li><li>**Execute Flow and Return** – executes a Flow Node and then returns to the question step and behaves as an Execute Flow Node.</li><li>**Handover to Human Agent** – hands the conversation over to a human agent and behaves the same as a Handover to Human Agent Node.</li></ul> |

    | Maximum Estimated Wait Time                          | CognigyScript        | Defines the maximum estimated wait time in milliseconds. If this duration is exceeded, the alternative text is sent. This parameter appears if **Alternative Update** is selected.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
    | Alternative Text                                     | CognigyScript        | The message sent to the user when the maximum queue position or wait time threshold is reached. This ensures users are informed and reduces frustration while waiting for an human agent.                                                                                                                                                        |

  <Accordion title="Reconfirmation Options">

    Allows for answers to be reconfirmed before continuing.
    This is especially useful when using voice agents and reconfirming what the agent understood
    (for example, in Number questions when the user said "_my number is three double five triple nine five six eight_").
    The answer given to the reconfirmation question has
    to be a yes/no style answer and follows the same rules as a Yes/No Question.

    Reconfirmation Questions can contain a specific token `ANSWER`, which is replaced with a short form version of the given answer (for example, "3 EUR" in a Money question). The short form answer is taken from `input.activeQuestion.tentativeShortFormAnswer`;

    Reconfirmation Questions can have a specific re-prompt set, which is output before the question if the answer to the question is not of yes/no style.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Advanced">

    **Store detailed Results**

    This setting, when enabled, stores a more detailed JSON object under the result property of the input. This is useful in case more information is needed.

    **Skip if Answer in Input**

    When enabled, this setting skips the Question if the answer is already provided in the input text.

    **Additional Validation**

    A [CognigyScript](/ai/platform-features/cognigyscript) condition which must return `true` in order for the answer to be considered valid. An example would be an additional validation on an Email Question of `input.slots.EMAIL[0].endsWith("cognigy.com")` which would guarantee that only cognigy.com email addresses pass the validation.

    **Result Location**

    The location of an answer is determined by default by the question type (for example, `input.slots.EMAIL[0]` for Email Questions). This can be overwritten using this setting (for example, `input.slots.EMAIL` would store all found email slots). If the result location doesn't return a value (= is falsy), the answer is considered invalid.

    **Forget Question Threshold**

    This setting determines how long a user can have been "away" from the Node after the question was initially asked. With the default setting `1` this means that the question has to be answered on the next user input. If a user input comes back to the question at a later stage, it is treated as if the question was hit for the first time and the question is asked.

  <Accordion title="AI-Enhanced Output">

    To use AI-enhanced output rephrasing, read the [Generative AI](/ai/agents/develop/gen-ai-and-llms/generative-ai) article.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Answer Preprocessing">

    You can use various functions of the [Text Cleaner](/ai/platform-features/nlu/text-cleaner) class to preprocess the answer to a question before it is evaluated. This can be helpful, for example, when requesting a name using a `text` type question or when asking for a part number using a `slot` question.

    In addition to the Text Cleaner functions, users have the option to rerun NLU after the cleaning process. This approach allows for tasks such as re-detecting slots or properly filling any remaining slots.

### Exclude from Transcript

Excludes the Node output from the conversation transcript. The output remains visible to the end user but isn't stored in the [`transcript`](/ai/agents/develop/ai-agent-memory/input#nested-objects) object or shared with the LLM provider.

You can use this parameter to:

- Hide sensitive or irrelevant data, such as legal disclaimers, so the model doesn't see or repeat them.
- Prevent the model from copying patterns (called in-context learning) you didn't want it to learn.

<Accordion title="Example">
  By default, the model model repeats the question style it learned from the AI Agent’s earlier question, even though the end user asked for an answer, not a question.

  ```txt
  AI Agent: What is your favorite color? (included in the conversation transcript)
  End User: Blue.
  Later:
  End User: Tell me your favorite food.
  AI Agent: What is your favorite food?
  ```

  By excluding the AI Agent's earlier question from the transcript, the same conversation looks like this:

  ```txt
  AI Agent: What is your favorite color? (included in the conversation transcript)
  End User: Blue.
  Later:
  End User: Tell me your favorite food.
  AI Agent: I enjoy pizza.
  ```
  Use this parameter to maintain confidentiality, for example, prevent sensitive data from reaching the LLM, or to display messages such as legal disclaimers or system notes that shouldn't affect the AI Agent's behavior.
</Accordion>

## Question Information in Input

When a question is active, meaning that the AI Agent is waiting for the answer, information regarding the question is added to the Input object.

```JSON
"activeQuestion": {
    "nodeId": "18b158bf-71a3-4d4f-a31f-812b1810f8af",
    "type": "yesNo",
    "lastExecutedAt": 2,
    "forgetQuestionThreshold": 1,
    "repromptCount": 1,
    "escalationCount": 0
}
``` 

This information can be used to trigger specific actions on escalation or to jump back to the Question Node after an escalation.

<Accordion title="Slot Fillers">
  Questions can be combined with **Slot Fillers** to create a "Missing Pattern". This mechanism keeps asking the user for the missing information in a very natural way, until all questions have been answered.
