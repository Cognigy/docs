## Description

This Node prompts end users to give feedback or rate their conversation experience using a rating widget in a chat.
The Node is typically placed at the end of a Flow to collect final feedback from conversations with either AI or human agents.

In contrast to the [Set Rating Node](/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/analytics/set-rating), the Request Rating Node doesn't rate a conversation automatically.

## Restrictions

- The Webchat v2 Endpoint doesn't support all parameters in this Node. You can still use it to [implement rating for Webchat v2](#implement-rating-for-webchat-v2).

## Parameters
