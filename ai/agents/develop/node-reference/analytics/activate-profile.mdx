## Description

This Node is used to reactivate a [specific Contact Profile](/ai/agents/analyze/contact-profiles#working-with-contact-profiles) that has been deactivated, in case the user disabled data collection by mistake or wants to allow data collection again.

## Use Case

Consider placing this Node below an [If](/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/logic/if) Node to trigger it when the contact allows collecting their data.
