The Search Extract Output Node uses an embedding model to search [Knowledge Stores](/ai/agents/develop/knowledge-ai/knowledge-store) and a generative AI model to extract relevant information and generate outputs. For example, you can upload manuals and technical documents as [Knowledge Sources](/ai/agents/develop/knowledge-ai/knowledge-source/overview) to create an AI Agent that helps customers with technical issues.


## Prerequisites

- For the Search only mode, you need access to an embedding model that [supports Knowledge Search](/ai/agents/develop/gen-ai-and-llms/model-support-by-feature).
- For the Search & Extract & Output and Search & Extract modes, you need access to both an embedding model and a generative AI model to support [Knowledge Search and Answer Extraction](/ai/agents/develop/gen-ai-and-llms/model-support-by-feature).

## Modes

The Search Extract Output Node has the following modes:

- **Search & Extract & Output** — With this mode, the AI Agent searches Knowledge Sources, extracts answers, and outputs the results automatically as text or adaptive card.
- **Search & Extract** — With this mode, the AI Agent searches Knowledge Sources and extracts answers. You have the flexibility to use these answers in other Nodes or Extension Nodes.
- **Search only** — With this mode, the AI Agent searches Knowledge Sources. You have the flexibility to use the information found. 

For more detailed information about the Search Extract Output Node, read the [Node reference](/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/other-nodes/search-extract-output).
