A _Knowledge Store_ provides a centralized and structured environment for managing and categorizing [Knowledge Sources](/ai/agents/develop/knowledge-ai/knowledge-source/overview). Knowledge Stores help streamline the knowledge management process by grouping related Knowledge Sources, making it easier to search and retrieve relevant information during Run-time. You can select Knowledge Stores in [Search Extract Output Nodes](/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/other-nodes/search-extract-output) to retrieve information from Knowledge Sources for your AI Agents.

## Prerequisites

- You have added a [Large Language Model (LLM) to your Project](/ai/agents/develop/gen-ai-and-llms/providers/all-providers) that [supports Knowledge Search](/ai/agents/develop/gen-ai-and-llms/model-support-by-feature).

## Restrictions

- All Knowledge Stores within a Project use the same embedding model. After you [configure the embedding model of your first Knowledge Store](/ai/agents/develop/knowledge-ai/overview), all other Knowledge Stores will use the same embedding model. If you want to switch to a different embedding model, delete all existing Knowledge Stores in the current Project and create new ones, or [create a new Project](/ai/agents/develop/projects-and-flows/projects).

## Working with Knowledge Stores

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="GUI">
        You can view, create, edit, and delete Knowledge Stores in **Build > Knowledge**. Also, you can copy Knowledge Stores' Reference ID and export Knowledge Stores as Packages.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="API">
        You can view, create, edit, and delete Knowledge Stores using the [Cognigy.AI API](https://api-trial.cognigy.ai/openapi#tag--KnowledgeStores).
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="CLI">
        You can create Knowledge Stores using the [Cognigy.AI CLI](https://github.com/Cognigy/Cognigy-CLI/blob/main/KNOWLEDGE-AI-README).
