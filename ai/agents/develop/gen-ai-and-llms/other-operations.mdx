Once you've added an LLM to Cognigy.AI, you can perform the following operations with your model:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Clone a Model">
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="GUI">
             To create a copy of the existing model, follow these steps:

             1. Go to **Build > LLM**.
             2. Hover over the existing model and click ![vertical-ellipsis](/_assets/icons/black-and-white/vertical-ellipsis.svg).
             3. Select **Clone** from the list.

             The model will contain the same settings as the initial one.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="API">
             To create a copy of the existing model, use the [Cognigy.AI API POST /v2.0/largelanguagemodels/{largeLanguageModelId}/clone](https://api-trial.cognigy.ai/openapi#post-/v2.0/largelanguagemodels/-largeLanguageModelId-/clone) request.

      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Set a Model as Default">

    Setting a default model ensures a smooth transition when a specific model is removed. It guarantees that there is always a model available to handle compatible use cases, even if the assigned model is removed.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="GUI">

            To set a model as the default, follow these steps:

            1. Go to **Build > LLM**.
            2. Hover over the existing model and click ![vertical-ellipsis](/_assets/icons/black-and-white/vertical-ellipsis.svg).
            3. Select **Make Default** from the list.

            The setting will be applied for the selected model.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="API">
            To set a model as the default, use the `"isDefault": true` parameter in the [Cognigy.AI API PATCH /v2.0/largelanguagemodels/{largeLanguageModelId}](https://api-trial.cognigy.ai/openapi#patch-/v2.0/largelanguagemodels/-largeLanguageModelId-) request. 
      
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Export a Model as a Package">

    To reuse a model in other Projects, package the model.

    To package a model, follow these steps:

    1. Go to **Build > LLM**.
    2. Hover over the existing model and click ![vertical-ellipsis](/_assets/icons/black-and-white/vertical-ellipsis.svg).
    3. Select **Create a package**.
    4. Once the package has created, a new [task](/ai/agents/develop/projects-and-flows/projects), titled **Create package**, will be run. To view the task, click ![task-menu](/_assets/icons/blue/task-menu.svg) in the upper-right corner.

    When the task is completed, you can download the Package in the Task Panel.
    To ensure the model works correctly in a different Project, export its [connection](/ai/platform-features/connections) as a Package.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Delete a Model">

    Note that a default model cannot be deleted. Before deletion, you need to remove the default tag.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="GUI">
            To delete a model, follow these steps:

            1. Go to **Build > LLM**.
            2. Hover over the existing model and click ![vertical-ellipsis](/_assets/icons/black-and-white/vertical-ellipsis.svg).
            3. Select **Delete**.
            4. Confirm the deletion. Features relying on this model will stop working if no default model is configured to support those features.

            The model will be deleted from the list.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="API">
            To delete a model, use the [Cognigy.AI API DELETE /v2.0/largelanguagemodels/{largeLanguageModelId}](https://api-trial.cognigy.ai/openapi#delete-/v2.0/largelanguagemodels/-largeLanguageModelId-).
     </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Accordion>
