Cognigy.AI offers a platform-provided LLM based on the Azure OpenAI GPT-4o family of models. This model is fully integrated into the platform and requires no additional setup or configuration.
Use this model to set up and test [design-time features](/ai/agents/develop/gen-ai-and-llms/generative-ai#design-time-generative-ai-features).

## Prerequisites

- The platform-provided LLM is available only for SaaS installations.

## Apply the Model

Starting with version 2025.14, this model is selected by default for design-time features in new Projects.

To apply another model, go to **Manage > Settings > Generative AI Settings** and select a model in the **Design-Time LLM Features** section.

For Projects created before 2025.14, the model you previously selected will remain in use.
