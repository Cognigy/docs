Agent Copilot is a Cognigy product designed to empower human agents with context-specific information, next-step suggestions, and more during conversations. With Agent Copilot, you also have a fully customizable workspace that integrates into your contact center platform to expand its capabilities and improve your interactions with customers. You can control and customize Agent Copilot's behavior entirely from the Flow in Cognigy.AI.

Additionally, you can combine [Agent Copilot with Voice Gateway](/agent-copilot/voice/voice-overview.mdx) to handle voice calls while still profiting from Agent Copilot's support.

## Core Components

### Flow

Agent Copilot uses specific Nodes from Flows to entirely control how the Agent Copilot workspace looks and behaves. Your Agent Copilot Flow serves only to define the Agent Copilot tiles and provides a separate environment from other Flows. In Agent Copilot Flows, you can perform knowledge searches, display customer information to human agents, and many other actions.

For more information, read the [Agent Copilot Nodes](/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/agent-copilot/overview) documentation.

### Backend

The Agent Copilot backend listens to the Agent Copilot Flow and handles the logic execution, API calls, and dynamic updates.

### Frontend

The frontend interface is a grid-like workspace that displays the configured tiles to human agents and updates in real time during conversations. You can run the frontend as a standalone app or embedded in your contact center platform.

#### Standalone

A separate app that you can open in your browser and that shows the full Agent Copilot workspace. The human agent receives a link to Agent Copilot in the conversation.

#### Embedded

The Agent Copilot tiles are displayed directly in your contact center platform via an iFrame.
