_Handover Status_ lets you manage and respond to the state of conversations handed over to human agents. It provides real-time updates on handover progress, enabling you to design dynamic, context-aware conversational experiences.

When a conversation is handed over to a human agent, your AI Agent can react to the current handover status — guiding the Flow based on whether the conversation is queued, actively handled, completed, or has encountered an issue.

This capability is particularly valuable when building experiences with Agent Copilot Flows, as it allows you to deliver contextual messages and implement fallback handling tailored to the current handover state.

## Key Benefits

Using Handover Status in your Flows provides several benefits:

- **Improved user experience**. Keep end users informed about their status, estimated wait time, and position in the queue, while preventing confusion from duplicate chats.
- **Smarter automation**. Automatically route conversations based on real-time status, trigger fallback handling, or escalate when errors occur.
- **Context-aware communication**. Send tailored messages depending on whether a conversation is queued, active, completed, or in progress.
- **Flexible integration**. Compatible with multiple platforms, including Cognigy Live Agent, Genesys Cloud, and RingCentral Engage.

## How it Works

To react to handover statuses, use a Lookup Node directly after the Handover to Agent Node.
A Lookup Node creates different Flow paths based on a chosen operand.

The example shows how to structure your handover logic using a Lookup Node with Handover Status:

## Supported Statuses

The table  lists all handover statuses you can configure in the Case Node following a Lookup Node.

| Queue                        | Conversations are on hold, waiting for an agent. You can inform the user with a Say Node, for example: `Estimated time: {{input?.handover?.data?.estimatedWaitTime / 1000}} seconds` and `Position: {{input?.handover?.data?.position}}`. If you use Agent Copilot, add a Handover Node, Lookup Node, and a Say Node in your Copilot Flow. In the Main Flow, add a Go To Node after the Queue Case Node to lead into the Copilot Flow.| Only available for:<ul><li>RingCentral Engage (with **Get Queue Updates** active)</li><li>Cognigy Live Agent</li></ul> |
| Handover Already in Progress | Triggered when the same user ID opens multiple conversations. The older conversation becomes inactive and is linked to the newer one in the same agent chat window. Add a Say Node to notify the user that the older chat is now inactive.                                                                                                                                                                                            | Only available for **Genesys Cloud Messaging**                                                                         |
