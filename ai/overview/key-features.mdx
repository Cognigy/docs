## [Agentic AI](/ai/agents/overview)

Agentic AI combines the language and reasoning abilities of LLMs with real-time context, memory, tools and enterprise governance to create AI Agents that understand intent, flexibly handle digression and multi-turn conversations, and take action based on the conversation context in contrast to classic linear flows.

Cognigy.AI allows for seamless combination of Agentic AI with deterministic, rule-based automation, enabling enterprise control where needed and adaptability for sophisticated interactions (Hybrid AI).

## [AI Agent Studio](/ai/agents/develop/projects-and-flows/editor)

Cognigy's AI Agent Studio (Flow editor) offers a low/no-code collaborative, visual interface for business users, conversation designers and developers to co-create, deploy and manage AI Agents. It provides AI-assisted design, powerful tooling for scalable testing and debugging, and 100+ channel and system connectors, accelerating development and time-to-value. You can create projects, manage resources like LLMs and collaborate in real time on Agents.

## [Knowledge AI](/ai/agents/develop/knowledge-ai/overview)

Cognigy.AI can ingest existing knowledge sources such as documents or internal repositories like SharePoint or Confluence into vector databases. AI Agents then employ Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), enabling the AI Agent to accurately answer user queries in natural language based on the individual conversation context, instead of a standardized reply.

## [NLU](/ai/platform-features/nlu/overview)

Cognigy NLU is an intent-driven Natural Language Understanding AI solution for building deterministic or rule-based processes. Hybrid AI Cognigy.AI enables you to combine NLU with the language understanding and generation power of LLMs. This can be useful in extracting multiple entities from a single user utterance for example or understanding more complex utterances such as `me, my wife and our two kids` which an NLU can mistake as two people based on the word where as an LLM would understand the user means four total people. Cognigy's AI Agents can be built purely with NLU, purely with Agentic AI or using both within the same project and even within the same Agent.

## [Native Voice Gateway](/voice-gateway/technical-capabilities)

Cognigy’s native voice solution enables voice connectivity and supports a free choice of STT and TTS models from provides like Google, Microsoft, ElevenLabs, Deepgram and more.

## [Multimodal xApps](/xApps/use-cases)

xApps are mobile first, OS agnostic micro web applications that can be integrated in conversational experiences, enabling multimodal, transaction-ready interactions that transcend the constraints of traditional chat and voice channels. This enables customers to mix channels or transition to another within the same conversation, without losing context or having to start over. For example, a customer could send an image in the middle of a voice call, share their GPS location from a chat or make a payment while using WhatsApp.

## [Native Contact Center Integrations](/ai/escalate/handovers)

Cognigy is designed to be technology and platform agnostic, integrating with multiple CCaaS, CRM, case management solutions and more. Cognigy can sit “in front” of CCaaS solutions for example with voice and digital interactions routed between them if necessary. Cognigy’s Agent Copilot can also be integrated into the agent desktop of  CCaaS solutions or used standalone within a browser tab.

## [Analytics and Business Dashboard](/ai/agents/analyze/overview)

Understand and optimize how AI Agents perform across every channel using millions of data points while also measuring business impact with goals, time saved and cost savings based on your business. Insights are available in real-time, aggregated or at granularly for deep-dives into individual customer journeys for example. Data can also be used in external analytics applications such as PowerBI.
