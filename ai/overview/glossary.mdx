**CognigyScript**

A JavaScript superset developed for Cognigy.AI. CognigyScript lets users configure AI Agents to access and manipulate the Input, Context, and Profile objects dynamically. For more information, read the [CognigyScript](/ai/platform-features/cognigyscript) documentation.

**Connections**

A Cognigy.AI resource that securely stores and manages credentials for integrating external services or APIs with the platform. Connections let AI Agents access and interact with external systems, such as databases, APIs, or third-party services, while ensuring sensitive information, such as API keys or access tokens, is securely encrypted. For more information, read the [Connections](/ai/platform-features/connections) article.

**Contact Profiles**

The stored data about the users that interact with your AI Agents. Contact Profiles persistently store user data and help to personalize conversations, even across different channels. You can access Contact Profiles from a Flow through the [Profile](/ai/agents/develop/ai-agent-memory/profile) object and manage them with specific Nodes. For more information, read the [Contact Profiles](/ai/agents/analyze/contact-profiles) article.

**Context Object**

A JSON object that stores session-specific data. The Context object is generated when a user starts a conversation with an AI Agent, which triggers the start of a session. When the user disconnects from Cognigy.AI, the session data persists in the [Context](/ai/agents/develop/ai-agent-memory/context) object and is retrieved upon reconnection with the same session ID. This method allows for multichannel conversations by accessing the Context object when the user connects from a different channel. You can also use CognigyScript to access the Context object and generate more context-aware AI Agent responses. For more information, read the [Context](/ai/agents/develop/ai-agent-memory/context) documentation.
