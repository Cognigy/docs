title: Roles
---

In Live Agents, human agents can have three distinct user roles:

- [Agent](#agents)
- [Supervisor](#supervisor)
- [Administrator](#administrator)

These roles define the permissions and responsibilities of individuals using the Live Agents system.

## User Roles 

### Agent

Agents in this role can access inboxes and conversations, assign conversations to other agents or themselves, and resolve conversations. They can access only the inboxes they are part of, participate in conversations within those inboxes, edit their user profile settings, and add personal-level canned responses. Conversation assignment is limited to inbox members.

### Supervisor

Supervisors have unique access to the Supervisor Dashboard to monitor conversation metrics and can also view the Inbox assigned to them.

### Administrator

Administrators have all permissions of a normal agent and access to all Cognigy Live Agent features enabled for your account, including settings. Administrators don't have permission to:

- View the supervisor dashboard. This dashboard is exclusive to the supervisor role.
- Create and delete users. You can only do this in the [Cognigy.AI Admin Center](/ai/administer/access/admin-center/access-control).

## Permissions

The following tables show single role permissions of Agents, Supervisors, and Administrators.

You can assign roles to human agent.

To create an Agent with certain access rights, do the following steps:

1. Create an Agent from the [Cognigy.AI Access Control](/ai/administer/access/admin-center/access-control).
2. Assign one of the following roles to the Agent:
    - `liveAgentAgent`
    - `liveAgentSupervisor`
    - `liveAgentAdmin` <br/>If you have an Admin role in Cognigy.AI, you do not need to add the Administrator role for your user because the Cognigy.AI role already includes the right to administer Live Agent.
3. _(Optional)_ Add any additional roles the Agent should have. For example, if you already have a `liveAgentAgent` role, you can add a `liveAgentSupervisor` role to allow access to the Overview report.
4. View the created user in Live Agent. Go to **Settings > Agents** in the Live Agent menu.

To see the roles applied to the Agent, the specific Agent must log in once to have the roles applied.

## Troubleshooting

### Assigned Roles are not Applied

If a human agent already has a specific role in Live Agent, assigned roles may not be applied.
For example, if you want to assign a user with `Administrator` rights the role of `Supervisor`,
the new role will only take effect once the user logs out of Cognigy.AI and Live Agent.
After logging out and logging back in, the new roles should be applied successfully.
