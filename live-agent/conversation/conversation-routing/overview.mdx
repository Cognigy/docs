_Conversation routing_ is the mechanism used to assign and distribute incoming conversations to the appropriate human agents for handling. It involves intelligent routing algorithms that consider factors like agent availability and workload to determine a recipient for each conversation. In Cognigy Live Agent, conversation routing ensures that conversations are efficiently directed to the right agents or teams, enabling timely and effective customer support. This feature optimizes resource utilization and enhances the productivity of human agents.

In Live Agent, there are two routing modes:

- [Manual](/live-agent/conversation/conversation-routing/manual-mode)
- [Automatic](/live-agent/conversation/conversation-routing/automatic-mode)

Conversation routing can consider a [limit per agent](/live-agent/settings/account-settings#conversation-limit-per-agent) applied to both Manual and Automatic modes and can only be set up for all Inboxes.
