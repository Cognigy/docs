<MaintenanceMode />

_Manual mode_ can be helpful in scenarios requiring specialized expertise, urgent or high-priority cases, complex or sensitive issues, and or key customers. It enables organizations to provide personalized support, optimize customer experience, and efficiently handle conversations.

In manual mode, conversation can be manually assigned or reassigned to any users with the Live Agent [roles](/live-agent/roles): `Agent`, `Supervisor`, or `Administrator`.

## Manual Assignment

You can manually assign a conversation to an agent or team by following these steps:

1. In the left-side menu of Live Agent, click **Conversations**.
2. Go to the relevant conversation.
3. In the **Details** menu, go to the **Conversation Actions** section. Choose how you want to manage the conversation:
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Assign to an Agent">
         Assign the conversation to a human agent by selecting an agent from the **Assigned Agent** list. If you want to assign the conversation to yourself, click **→ Assign to me** above the list.
        </Tab>
      <Tab title="Escalate to a Supervisor">
       Escalate the conversation to a human agent with the `Supervisor` role by clicking the **↑ Escalate to Supervisor** button, which appears in the **Conversation Actions** section. The conversation will be automatically assigned to the available supervisor in the [Inbox](/live-agent/settings/inboxes#escalate-conversations-to-supervisors).


       <Accordion title="Supervisor Assignment Rules">
         A conversation remains unassigned if:

         - No supervisor is available in the Inbox.
         - An assigned supervisor changed its status to `Away` or `Offline`.
         - A supervisor is busy and [Assign conversation to a busy agent](/live-agent/settings/account-settings#auto-assign-conversations-to-busy-agents) is turned off.

         A conversation remains assigned if the supervisor was already assigned to it and then changed their status to `Busy`.
       </Accordion>

       <Note>
         Each conversation can be escalated via **↑ Escalate to Supervisor** button only once. Reassigning back to an agent disables the **Escalate to Supervisor** button. Use the **Assigned Agent** list to select a supervisor manually if needed.
       </Note>
       </Tab>
   </Tabs>
4. _(Optional)_ From the **Assigned Team** list, select a team that can be assigned to this conversation. The previously selected agent must be a part of this team.

After the assignment, the agent or a team can receive a [notification](/live-agent/notifications).

## Manual Reassignment

You can manually reassign a conversation to an agent or team by following these steps:

1. In the left-side menu of Live Agent, click **Conversations** and go to the relevant conversation.
2. In the **Details** menu, go to the **Conversation Actions** section.
3. From the **Assigned Agent** list, select a new agent that should be assigned to this conversation.
4. _(Optional)_ From the **Assigned Team** list, select a new team to be assigned to this conversation. The previously selected agent must be a part of this team.

If the conversation is reassigned, an agent can receive a [notification](/live-agent/notifications).

## Manual Unassignment

You can manually unassign a conversation to an agent or team by following these steps:

1. In the left-side menu of Live Agent, click **Conversations** and go to the relevant conversation.
2. In the **Details** menu, go to the **Conversation Actions** section.
3. Above the **Assigned Agent** list, click **→ Unassign**.
4. Above the list **Assigned Team**, click **→ Unassign**.

If the **Unassign** value appears in the **Assigned Agent** list, the conversation will be displayed in the list of unassigned conversations.
