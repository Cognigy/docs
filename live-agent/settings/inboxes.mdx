_Inboxes_ are workspaces where human agents handle real-time chat interactions with customers and manage related tasks. Each Inbox ID represents the connection from Cognigy.AI to Live Agent. 

You can have an unlimited number of Inboxes in your Live Agent account, and you can view conversations specific to an Inbox by clicking on it. 

Within the Inbox setting, you can edit the Inbox, add and remove agents, configure message visibility for them, set up conversation routing, and add assistant bots.

## Create Inboxes

To create an Inbox in Live Agent, do the following:

1. In the Live Agent interface, go to **Settings > Inboxes**.
2. In the upper-right corner, click **+ Add Inbox**. Live Agent will show you a screen to set up your Inbox. 
3. On the **Inbox setup** page, fill in the following fields:
    - **Inbox Name** — create a unique Inbox name. For example, `Cognigy Handover`. The name can contain any characters, but can't start with `=`.
    - **Webhook URL** — enter the Cognigy.AI Endpoint Config URL domain name, extended by `/handover/liveagent`. For example, `https://endpoint-trial.cognigy.ai/handover/liveagent`. You can find the Endpoint Config URL in the **Configuration Information** section of your Endpoint.
4. In the **Pick agents for the inbox** list, select agents by either clicking it or hovering your cursor over it and then pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>. You can select multiple agents from the list. Agents can belong to different inboxes simultaneously.
5. Click the **Create Cognigy.AI Inbox** button. Once you have successfully set up the Inbox, you are prompted to assign your agents to the new Inbox in the next step.
6. Select the required agents from the selection list, then click **Add Agents**.

A new Live Agent Inbox has been created. You can configure the Inbox settings by clicking **More settings**.

<Note>
  Users with the `Agent` or `Supervisor` role can view only the Inboxes to which they are assigned. Users with the `Administrator` role can view all Inboxes. For more information on user permissions, refer to [Roles](/live-agent/roles).
</Note>

## Edit Inboxes

If you want to change how an Inbox works or reuse an Inbox from a deleted Project, you need to edit the Inbox.

To edit an Inbox, follow these steps:

1. In the Live Agent interface, go to **Settings > Inboxes**.
2. On the **Inboxes** page, click ![gear](/_assets/icons/black-and-white/gear.svg) next to the Inbox you want to edit.
3. In the **Inboxes Settings** section, update the following fields:
    - **Channel Avatar** — upload an image that represents the Inbox. The Channel Avatar helps you visually identify the Inbox. 
    - **Inbox Name** — enter a unique Inbox name.
    - **Cognigy Project ID** — this field is pre-populated for [Inboxes created through Cognigy.AI](/live-agent/getting-started/live-agent-setup/live-agent-setup-additional-inbox). Enter a valid Project ID. The Project ID allows Live Agent to retrieve [Contact Profile](/ai/agents/analyze/contact-profiles) data from Cognigy.AI and binds the Inbox to the respective Project. You can [copy the Project ID](/ai/agents/develop/projects-and-flows/projects) from the Cognigy.AI interface. After you assign the Inbox to a Project, [copy the Inbox ID](#copy-inbox-id) and enter it in the respective Cognigy.AI Nodes of the Project, for example, the [Handover Agent](/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/service/handover-to-agent) and [Check Agent Availability](/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/service/check-agent-availability) Nodes. If you delete the Project to which the Project ID refers, Live Agent can still communicate with Cognigy.AI Nodes, but the system cannot retrieve Contact Profile data through this Inbox.
    - **Webhook URL** — enter the Cognigy.AI Endpoint Config URL domain name, extended by `/handover/liveagent`. For example, `https://endpoint-trial.cognigy.ai/handover/liveagent`. You can find the Endpoint Config URL in the **Configuration Information** section of your Endpoint.
4. Click **Update**.

## Copy Inbox ID

Each Inbox ID represents the connection between Cognigy.AI and Live Agent and is used in API and UI URL paths.

To connect an Inbox to Cognigy.AI,
copy the ID of the Inbox
and specify it in the **Live Agent Settings** section in the [Handover to Human Agent](/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/service/handover-to-agent) Node on the Cognigy.AI side.

To copy an Inbox ID, follow these steps:

1. Go to Live Agent.
2. On the left side of the screen, select **Settings**.
3. In the settings column, select **Inboxes**.
4. On the **Configuration** tab, go to the **Inbox ID** section.
5. Click **Copy**.

## Delete Inboxes

Deleting an Inbox is irreversible and will cause a loss of synchronization with Cognigy.AI.

To delete an Inbox within Live Agent, do the following:

1. In the Live Agent interface, go to **Settings > Inboxes**. 
2. On the **Inboxes** page, to the right of the team you want to delete, click **Delete**. 
3. You are prompted to enter the Inbox name you want to delete. 
4. Click **Yes, Delete**.

The selected Inbox will be deleted.

## Control Conversation Routing within Inboxes

To configure the conversation assignments within Live Agent, do the following:

1. In the Live Agent interface, go to **Settings > Inboxes**. 
2. On the **Inboxes** page, to the right of the Inbox you want to change, click **Settings** and open the **Collaborators** tab. 
3. In the **Conversation Assignment** sections, update the conversation assignment settings:
    - [Allow auto assignment](/live-agent/conversation/conversation-routing/automatic-mode#automatic-assignment)
    - [Allow conversations to be reassigned](/live-agent/conversation/conversation-routing/automatic-mode#automatic-reassignment)

The changes will be applied successfully.

## Escalate Conversations to Supervisors

To allow agents to escalate conversations to supervisors within an Inbox, do the following:

1. In the Live Agent interface, go to **Settings > Inboxes**.
2. On the **Inboxes** page, to the right of the Inbox you want to change, click **Settings** and open the **Collaborators** tab.
3. In the **Supervisors** section, select supervisors by either clicking it or hovering your cursor over it and then pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>. You can select multiple supervisors from the list. Supervisors can belong to different inboxes simultaneously.
4. Once supervisors are added, configure escalation settings:
    - **Allow agents to escalate conversations to supervisors** — activate the option to let agents escalate conversations directly from the [Conversation Actions](/live-agent/conversation/assign-conversations) section.
    - **Send push notifications to supervisors** — activate the option to let supervisors receive real-time notifications when a conversation is escalated.
    - **Send email notifications to supervisors** — activate the option to let supervisors receive email notifications when a conversation is escalated.
5. Click **Update**. After applying these settings, the **↑ Escalate to Supervisor** button appears in the **Conversation Actions** section on the conversation page, allowing the agent to start an escalation. Refer to [Manual Assignment](/live-agent/conversation/conversation-routing/manual-mode) to learn more about supervisor assignment rules, and to [Conversation Queue](/live-agent/conversation/conversation-queue/overview) to see an example of conversation assignment.

## Add Agents to Inboxes

To add agents to an Inbox, do the following:

1. In the Live Agent interface, go to **Settings > Inboxes**.
2. On the **Inboxes** page, to the right of the Inbox you want to change, click **Settings**.
3. On the **Collaborators** tab, go to the **Agents** section.
4. In the agent list, select agents by either clicking it or hovering your cursor over it and then pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>. You can select multiple agents from the list. Agents can belong to different inboxes simultaneously.
5. Click **Update**.

The changes will be applied.

## Configure Agent Access to all Inbox Conversations

By default, your agents can see all messages within an Inbox. 
To change this behavior for agents with the `Agent` role, do the following:

1. In the Live Agent interface, go to **Settings > Inboxes**.
2. On the **Inboxes** page, to the right of the Inbox you want to change, click **Settings** and open the **Collaborators** tab.
3. In the **Conversation Assignment** section, disable the **Allow Agents to see all conversations in this inbox** setting.

The changes will be applied. Note that this setting will not affect agents with the `Administrator` or `Supervisor` roles.
They will still be able to see all messages within the Inbox.

## Remove Agents from Inboxes

To remove the Inbox appearance, do the following:

1. In the Live Agent interface, go to **Settings > Inboxes**.
2. On the **Inboxes** page, to the right of the Inbox you want to change, click **Settings**.
3. On the **Collaborators** tab, go to the **Agents** section.
4. In the agent list, remove an agent by clicking **x** on the right side of the agent's name.
5. Click **Update**.

## Add Agent Copilot Bots

Within an Inbox, you can add one or more Agent Copilot Bots to assist your human agents.
To create such a bot, you need to have a separate Flow and Endpoint on the Cognigy.AI side.
For more details, refer to [Agent Copilot Bot](/live-agent/assistants/agent-copilot-bot).
