Assistants in Cognigy.AI are tools designed to support human agents in their interactions with customers. They often involve AI-powered features, helping agents provide more effective assistance and enhance the overall customer experience.

With assistants, among other things, the following can be achieved:

- Provide contextual information for the agent (CRM records, ERP data, small talk clues, and more).
- Enable quick access to resources such as knowledge base articles.
- Suggest replies (including media) that can be forwarded to the customer.
