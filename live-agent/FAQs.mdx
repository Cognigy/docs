## Questions and Answers about Live Agent

### How to remove a user?

Removing a user (human agent) from Live Agent can be done from the Cognigy.AI [Members page](/ai/administer/access/members). The `liveAgentAdmin`/`liveAgentAgent` roles need to be removed, and this will prevent the human agent from logging into Live Agent. This can also be achieved by deleting the user from Cognigy.AI.

Head over to [Cognigy.AI Access Control](/ai/administer/access/admin-center/access-control) for more information.

### How to create an Agent with multiple roles?

To create an Agent with multiple roles, read the [Roles](/live-agent/roles#assign-roles) article.

### What happens if an Inbox is deleted?
Inboxes created manually can be safely deleted, except those with the `-default` suffix. Deleting Inboxes with `-default` breaks the integration between Live Agent and Cognigy.AI. If this Inbox is accidentally deleted, see the solution in the question below.

### What should I do if the Inbox is deleted?

You need to create a new Inbox. To do that, use the [Adding another Inbox for your Project](/live-agent/getting-started/live-agent-setup/live-agent-setup-additional-inbox) article.

### Where can I check what the default Inbox is? Does it have a special account id?

The default Inbox has a pattern name `XXXX-default`, for example, `7119-default`. You can rename it in [Inbox Settings](/live-agent/settings/inboxes).

### How to fix custom SSL certificate verification error?
That may happen because Cognigy.AI is running under a custom SSL certificate (Error can not validate certificate). And Live Agent is failing to perform the requests to it as SSL requests can not be verified.

Head over to [Rest Client SSL Helm values](/live-agent/installation/helm-values/helm-values#rest-client-ssl) for configuring it.

### How to fix SMTP for no authentication provider?

For self-hosted installations, the SMTP configuration needs to be modified.

A quick way is to select an Inbox on the dashboard screen. The URL will look like: ``https://<live-agent-domain>/app/accounts/1/inbox/4``.

The URL follows the pattern `accounts/{Account ID}/inbox/{Inbox ID}`, where the account ID is `1` and inbox ID is `4`.

## Live Agent OData service

### Why is the OData service not returning all the information from the database?
The OData service returns data belonging to your account.

Head over to [OData Endpoint](/live-agent/tools/odata-endpoint) for more information.

### How to retrieve all content from a particular collection?


You can retrieve all content from a particular collection, for example, Conversation, Message.

The following filtering query can be performed:

For example, `http://{{host}}:{{port}}/v1.0/odata/Conversation?$filter=created_at le '2126-11-23T00:00:00'`.

It will return all the fields for the Conversation model created before 23/11/2126. 

Head over to [OData Endpoint](/live-agent/tools/odata-endpoint) for more information.

### How to filter OData with specific fields?

To filter OData results by specific fields, you can use the `$select` and `$filter` query parameters. 

For example, `http://{{host}}:{{port}}/v1.0/odata/Conversation?$select=id,account_id&$filter=created_at le '2026-11-23T00:00:00'`.

In this example, the request is retrieving the `id` and `account_id` fields from the Conversation model, filtered by the `created_at` field being less than or equal to `2026-11-23T00:00:00`.

For more detailed information, refer to the [OData Endpoint](/live-agent/tools/odata-endpoint) article.
