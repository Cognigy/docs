## View Session Transcripts

Session transcripts are logged conversations between end users and agents. 
The Transcript explorer enables you to view session transcripts and analyze them to understand interactions between end users and agents better.
To view a session transcript, select a session from the list on the **Transcript Explorer** page.


<Frame>
  <img class="image-center" src="/_assets/insights/explorers/transcript/transcript-explorer-profile.png" style={{ width: 'auto' }} />
  <figcaption>Session Transcript with Debug Mode</figcaption>
</Frame>

### Session Transcript

Session transcripts display all individual messages between the end user and agent during their conversation. By selecting a session, the corresponding transcript will be displayed on the right side of the page.
You can use the scroll bar to navigate through the messages in the **Session Transcript** window.

<Note>
  The Session Transcript interface in the Transcript explorer is specifically designed for detailed analysis of past sessions, whereas the [Interaction Panel](/ai/agents/test/interaction-panel/overview) is primarily used for testing and debugging Flows.
  When you access a session transcript in the Transcript explorer, you may observe differences compared to the Interaction Panel. For example, the format and content of debug messages vary between these two tools.
</Note>

#### Debug Mode

Insights' Debug mode is not fully equal to the Debug mode in the [Interaction Panel](/ai/agents/test/interaction-panel/chat#debug-mode) documentation. Debug messages from Nodes (including Code Nodes and Debug Message Nodes) are only for immediate testing and can only be seen in the Interaction Panel.

The Debug mode offers additional context for conversation messages, including:

- Triggered Intent and its score
- Filled Slots
- User connection and disconnection events
- Voice event payloads
- xApp session details

Additionally, you can switch to a Flow related to the current session.

To use Debug mode, activate the **Debug mode** toggle at the top of the **Session Transcript** window.

#### Scenarios

You can create a [scenario](/ai/agents/test/simulator/overview) based on a session transcript. Scenarios allow you to simulate user interactions and test your Flows effectively.

<Note>
  To create a scenario, an LLM model must exist on [the LLMs page](/ai/agents/develop/gen-ai-and-llms/providers/all-providers). By default, the LLM model marked as [`default`](/ai/agents/develop/gen-ai-and-llms/other-operations#set-a-model-as-default) will be selected.
</Note>

To create a scenario from a transcript, do the following:

1. In the upper-right corner of the **Session Transcript** window, click ![vertical ellipsis](/_assets/icons/black-and-white/vertical-ellipsis.svg) to open a selection menu.
2. Select **Create Scenario**. You will be redirected to the Simulator interface, where the Scenario will be created based on the selected transcript. The persona for the scenario will be generated from scratch. Click **Create**, then [follow the instructions](/ai/agents/test/simulator/overview#2-simulate) to run the simulation.

#### Playbooks

To create a [Playbook](/ai/agents/test/playbooks) from a transcript, do the following:

1. In the upper-right corner of the **Session Transcript** window, click ![vertical ellipsis](/_assets/icons/black-and-white/vertical-ellipsis.svg) to open the selection menu.
2. Select one of the following options:
    - **Create Playbook** — generate a Playbook to test your Flows.
    - **Create Playbook with Assertions** — generate a Playbook and its Assertions, which are checks to ensure your Flows behave as expected during testing.

#### Open Message-Related Flow

To check your [Flow](/ai/agents/develop/projects-and-flows/overview) or to improve its configuration, the Transcript explorer provides the **Open Flow**context menu option.

To switch from the Transcript explorer to the corresponding Flow in Cognigy.AI, do the following:

1. In the left-side menu of the Insights interface, select **Transcript Explorer**.
2. On the **Transcript Explorer** page, select a session from the list. The session transcript will appear in a separate window on the right side of the page.
3. In the **Session Transcript** window, right-click a specific message and select **Open Flow**. The corresponding Flow in Cognigy.AI appears.

#### Navigate to Message explorer via Transcript Messages

You can access the [Message explorer](/insights/explorers/message) by selecting a message within the **Session Transcript** window.
The Message explorer shows you the previous and subsequent messages for the selected message.

To switch from the selected transcript message to the Message explorer, follow these steps:

1. On the **Transcript Explorer** page, select a session from the list. The session transcript will appear in a separate window on the right side of the page.
2. In the **Session Transcript** window, right-click a specific message and select **Open in Message Explorer**.

The Message explorer interface will be opened.

### Session Transcript Details

To get more session details, click ![user-menu](/_assets/icons/blue/user-menu.svg) in the upper-left corner of the **Session Transcript** window.

## Delete Sessions

You can delete a session and its transcript
by selecting the session from the list on the **Transcript Explorer** page
and clicking ![vertical ellipsis](/_assets/icons/black-and-white/vertical-ellipsis.svg) **> Delete Session Transcript** in the **Session Transcript Details** window.
The session will be deleted from the Transcript and Message explorers.
However, the session metadata will remain accessible through the [Cognigy.AI OData endpoint](/ai/agents/analyze/odata), except for the data in the [Conversation](/ai/agents/analyze/odata#conversations) collection.
Also, the Contact Profile details will still be available in the [Contact Profile](/ai/agents/analyze/contact-profiles).

<Note>
  If you've migrated to the new [Insights framework](/insights/data-management/pre-aggregation), there might be a delay between deleting the session transcript and the session itself. When you click the **Delete Session Transcript** button, the transcript is deleted first, and the session is deleted from the **Transcript Explorer** page about 10 minutes later.
