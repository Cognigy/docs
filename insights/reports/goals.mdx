  The Goals Report is in beta and is available if you have migrated to the new [Insights framework](/insights/data-management/pre-aggregation).
  Before migration, you can also explore the Goals Report in the Cognigy trial environment.
  We encourage you to try this feature out and provide us with feedback.
</Note>

The _Goals Report_ highlights goal tracking, completion status, time, revenue, and cost metrics, and the business impact of AI Agents in the following charts:

## Indicators

### Completed

Displays the total number of [completed goals](/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/analytics/track-goal).

### Partially Completed

Displays the total number of partially [completed goals](/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/analytics/track-goal).
This chart shows the goals for which some steps were not completed.

### Time Saved

Displays the total time saved for completed and partially completed goals.

### Cost Savings

Displays the total cost savings for completed and partially completed goals.

## Bar charts

### Goals Performance (in numbers)

Displays the number of goals achieved within the selected time span.
The goals have three distinct categories, each has a separate bar:

- **Incomplete** — goals that have been started, with only the initial step triggered.
- **Partial Completion** — goals that have been started and progressed through some steps, but the completion step was not achieved.
- **Total Completion** — goals that have been started, progressed through some steps, and at least one completion step was achieved.
