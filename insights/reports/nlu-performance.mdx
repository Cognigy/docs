The _NLU Performance Report_ provides valuable insights into the performance of your AI Agent's natural language understanding (NLU) capabilities. It allows you to monitor and enhance message comprehension, Intent recognition, and execution efficiency. Moreover, it offers easy access to resources like the Intent Trainer for further performance improvement.

You can find more information about our NLU and Intents in the [NLU Overview](/ai/platform-features/nlu/overview) article.

The NLU Performance data of your AI Agent is visualized in the following charts:

- [Indicators](/insights/reports/engagement#indicators) 
- [Bar charts](/insights/reports/engagement#bar-charts)
- [Line charts](/insights/reports/engagement#line-charts)

These charts display all data based on the [global filter](/insights/global-filters) and local filter settings.

## Indicators

The Indicator charts presents real-time data that refreshes every 30 seconds.

### Average Execution Time

Displays the average execution time across a specific timespan.

Formula:
 
Average Execution Time = `Sum of Execution Times / Total number of inputs`

### Avg Intent Score

Displays the average Intent score for the selected time span. Higher Intent scores indicate better AI Agent performance in matching user queries.
For more information, see [Machine Learning Intents](/ai/platform-features/nlu/intents/overview).        

To find the average intent score, Insights sums up all the intent scores and divides the sum by the total number of records.

Source table:

```txt
| Analytics Record | Intent Score |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| Record-1         | 0.30         |
| Record-2         | 0.90         |
| Record-3         | 0.10         |
| Record-4         | 1            |
| Record-5         | 0.20         |
| Record-6         | 0.02         |
| Record-7         | 0.50         |
```
Calculation:

1. Sum of Intent Scores = `0.30 + 0.90 + 0.10 + 1 + 0.20 + 0.02 + 0.50 = 3.02`
2. Number of Records = `7`
3. Average Intent Score = `(Sum of Intent Scores) / (Number of Records)`
4. Average Intent Score = `3.02 / 7`

Result: `0.43`

### Max Intent Score

Indicates the number of Intents that were matched with 100% efficacy.

Source table:

```txt
| Analytics Record | Intent Score |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| Record-1         | 0.30         |
| Record-2         | 0.90         |
| Record-3         | 0.10         |
| Record-4         | 1            |
| Record-5         | 0.20         |
| Record-6         | 0.02         |
| Record-7         | 0.50         |
```

Result: In the provided source table, there is one record with an intent score of `1`, so the max intent score is `1`.

## Bar charts

### Top Intents

Displays the top-rated number of Intents. The summary view shows a maximum of 6 Intents, while the detailed view displays up to 25. Matching an Intent triggers its recording in the analytics data. The data is then grouped by the matched Intent and sorted in descending order.
Source table: 

```txt
|  Intent           | Total number  |
| ----------------- | ------------- |
| Flight discounts  |      12       |
| Book a flight     |      5        |
| Change a flight   |      5        |
| Additional fee    |      4        |
| Reject a flight   |      3        |
| Transfer flights  |      3        |
```

### Top Slots

Similar to **Top Tasks** and **Top Intents**, this chart displays top-rated number of slots in a horizontal bar chart.

Source table:

```txt 
| Slot        | Number      |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| DATE        | 2           |

### Intents by Score Range

Displays the scoring range of matched Intents. Each score range is displayed as a bar with minimum, maximum, and average values.
Clicking on the three-dots menu item,
you can select the **Go to Intent Trainer** that leads you to the application in Cognigy.AI to improve your Flow.
