Whenever you feel stuck or encounter a problem on our platform, don't hesitate to ask for help. There are many ways to get help, some of which are described on this page.

## In-Product Contextual Help

Inside Cognigy.AI, you can find contextual in-product help by clicking the Help icon in the App Bar on the upper right of the screen.

When clicking on this menu, the help widget will open, and you can search for help directly within the product.

## Help Center

Every article in the Help Widget comes from the Cognigy Help Center, which can be reached by clicking the "View original article" link.

Alternatively, you can always reach the [Cognigy Help Center](https://support.cognigy.com/hc/en-us).

## Submit Support Tickets

In case you've found a bug or need technical assistance, you can file a support ticket. You can do this in three ways:

1. Directly from the Help Widget inside Cognigy.AI by clicking **Contact US** at the bottom.
2. By registering at [https://support.cognigy.com](https://support.cognigy.com) and filing a ticket from there.
3. By sending an email to [support@cognigy.com](mailto:support@cognigy.com).

## Ticket Content Recommendations

For a better and faster handling of your ticket, you should provide as much information as you can give us.

The following sections describe recommended attachments and information you could send us to accelerate the ticket handling process. 

## General Problems

For an issue which you can't really associate with a specific resource (flow, endpoint etc.) add at least a screenshot of the console (**F12**) as an attachment to the ticket.

## Problems with Flows

The ticket for a problem with a flow should have the Flow and all its dependencies attached.

You can also attach a screenshot of the [logs](/ai/agents/test/logs) to the ticket. 

## Problems with the UI

In addition to your description, add a screenshot of the bug to your ticket.
