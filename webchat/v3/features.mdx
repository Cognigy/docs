## Customization  

Customization includes a comprehensive suite of features 
that bolster your brand's presence and enhance user accessibility. 
Customize the chat interface with your brand's title and logo, 
alongside distinct avatars for both AI and human agents, 
and adjust the color scheme across various elements. 
Accessibility is prioritized with Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text functionalities. 
Starting behavior customization sets the tone for engagement, 
allowing for a tailored initial interaction, such as a greeting message or a start button. 
Operational settings, including business hours, ensure users are clearly informed about the availability of support. 
Collectively, these customization options create a personalized and efficient webchat experience 
that aligns with your operational requirements and brand image.

These elements work together to create an inviting and branded entry point for user interactions, ensuring a seamless and appealing start to the chat experience.

<Frame>
  <img class="image-center" src="/_assets/webchat/v3/text-with-buttons.png" style={{ width: 'auto' }} />

<Frame>
  <img class="image-center" src="/_assets/webchat/v3/persistent-menu.png" style={{ width: 'auto' }} />
</Frame>

To configure the Persistent Menu, refer to the [Webchat Layout](/webchat/v3/configuration#webchat-layout) settings.

## Controlling the Chat Window

The Chat screen provides buttons for minimizing or closing the chat window:

- **Minimize** — this button collapses the window without ending a conversation. Users can return to the chat by expanding the window again. The `webchat/minimize` event is triggered when users click the **Minimize** button.
- **Close** — this button collapses the window without ending a conversation. Users can return to the chat by expanding the window again. The `webchat/close` event is triggered when users click the **Close** button.
    If you want the **Close** button to end the conversation and close the window, extend the [embedding file](/webchat/v3/embedding/hosted-script) with the following code:

    <Accordion title="webchat.endSession">
      ```js
      webchat.registerAnalyticsService(event => {
        if (event.type === "webchat/close") {
          webchat.endSession();
        }
      });
      ```
      For more information, read [Analytics API](https://github.com/Cognigy/Webchat/blob/main/docs/analytics-api.md) on GitHub.
    </Accordion>
<Frame>
  <img class="image-center" src="/_assets/webchat/v3/minimize-and-close-window.png" style={{ width: 'auto' }} />
</Frame>

## Attachment Upload

To send certain media files to users, use the Attachment Upload feature.

<Frame>
  <img class="image-center" src="/_assets/webchat/v3/attachment.png" style={{ width: 'auto' }} />
</Frame>

For enabling attachment uploads, refer to the [Attachment Upload](/webchat/v3/configuration#attachment-upload) settings.

## Date Picker

Whenever your AI Agent prompts for a date input via the Webchat, users can select the date using an interactive Date Picker. 
After clicking the Date Picker button, a full-screen overlay will appear in the Webchat, allowing the user to choose a date within the constraints defined by the AI Agent.

<Frame>
  <img class="image-center" src="/_assets/webchat/v3/date-picker.png" style={{ width: 'auto' }} />
</Frame>

To use a Date Picker, add the [Date Picker](/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/data/datepicker) Node within your Flow.

## xApp Overlay

By default, an xApp page opens in a separate browser tab.
In Webchat v3, you can change this behavior by opening xApp pages directly within the Webchat v3 interface.
This means that each xApp page will be displayed on its own dedicated screen.
This approach helps end users to focus solely on the content of that page without distractions from other parts of the interface.
The design of xApp screens is consistent with other Webchat v3 screens such as [Home](#home-screen), [Chat Options](#chat-options), [Previous Conversations](#previous-conversations), and more.

<Frame>
  <img class="image-center" src="/_assets/webchat/v3/xApp-overlay.png" style={{ width: 'auto' }} />
</Frame>

To configure this behavior for pages with HTML and Adaptive Cards, use the following Nodes:

- [xApp: Show HTML](/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/xApp/set-html-xApp-state)
- [xApp: Show Adaptive Card](/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/xApp/set-AdaptiveCard-xApp-state)

## RTL Language Support

Alongside the traditional left-to-right (LTR) layout, Webchat v3 supports right-to-left (RTL). This feature is especially beneficial for languages such as Arabic,
Persian (Farsi), Hebrew, Urdu, and other languages that use this writing direction. Supporting RTL layouts lets users from various regions interact with the Webchat widget in their native languages that enhances the user experience
and leads to more effective and personalized interactions with the AI Agent.

All elements of the Webchat widget are aligned for RTL, including the positioning of the widget itself, which now appears in the bottom-left corner of the web page. This adjustment ensures that users who speak languages with a right-to-left writing direction can easily interact with the chat, as it aligns with their usual reading and writing patterns.

<Frame>
  <img class="image-center" src="/_assets/webchat/v3/rtl-support.png" style={{ width: 'auto' }} />
</Frame>

To use RTL, add the attribute `dir="rtl"` to the `<html>` tag, which is placed at the beginning of the HTML-page.
For more information, read [RTL Configuration](/webchat/v3/embedding/hosted-script#rtl-configuration). To test this feature, [build Webchat v3 locally](https://github.com/Cognigy/Webchat/blob/main/README#development).
