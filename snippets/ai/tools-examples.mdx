### Tool

In this example, the `unlock_account` tool unlocks a user account by providing the email and specifying the reason for the unlocking.

Parameter configuration in JSON:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "email": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "User's login email for their account."
    }
  },
  "required": ["email"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

where:

- `type` — the type for a tool parameter schema, which must always be `object`.
- `properties` — defines the parameters for the tool configuration:
    - `email` — a required tool parameter for unlocking the account.
        - `type` — defines the data type for the tool parameter.
        - `description` — a brief explanation of what the property represents.
- `required` — lists `email` as a required parameter, ensuring that this value is always provided when the tool is called.
- `additionalProperties` — ensures that the input contains only the `email` tool parameter, and no others are allowed.

### MCP Tool and Call MCP Tool

#### Use Zapier's Remote MCP server

You can create a custom MCP server with personalized tools by using one of the [provided SDKs](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol). For a quicker setup, you can use a third-party provider. For example, [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) allows you to [configure your MCP server](https://actions.zapier.com/settings/mcp/), which can be connected to multiple application APIs.

To use Zapier as a remote MCP server, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Zapier account, go to the [MCP settings](https://actions.zapier.com/settings/mcp/) page, and configure your MCP server.
2. Copy the SSE URL and paste it into the **MCP Server SSE URL** field of your MCP Tool Node.
3. In the Zapier MCP settings, create an action to connect to various APIs. For example, you can create a Zapier action to automatically generate a Google Doc.

Once the setup is complete, the configured MCP Actions will be loaded when the AI Agent is executed.

You will see the following debug message in the Interaction Panel, indicating the result of the tool call after a successful execution:

```txt
AI Agent: MCP Tool
Fetched tools from MCP Tool "zapier"

- google_docs_create_document_from_: Create a new document from text. Also supports limited HTML.
  Parameters:
  - title (string): Document Name
  - file (string): Document Content
```

### Knowledge Tool

In this example, you have two Knowledge tools to search two different Knowledge Stores. Each Knowledge Store refers to a different product category, in this example, appliances and furniture. To guide the AI Agent to use the correct Knowledge tool, enter a clear tool ID and description:

- Knowledge Tool 1:
  - Tool ID: `search_appliances`
  - Description: `Find the answer to prompts or questions about appliances by searching the attached data sources. Use this tool when a customer asks about appliance items such as washing machines, dryers, and other household appliances. Focus exclusively on a knowledge search and does not execute tasks like small talk, calculations, or script running.`
- Knowledge Tool 2:
  - Tool ID: `search_furniture`
  - Description: `Find the answer to prompts or questions about furniture by searching the attached data sources. Use this tool when a customer asks about furniture items such as sofas, tables, and other items. Focus exclusively on a knowledge search and does not execute tasks like small talk, calculations, or script running.`
