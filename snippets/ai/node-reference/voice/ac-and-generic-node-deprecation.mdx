<Warning>
  - AudioCodes Nodes and Generic Voice Nodes have been deprecated. Flows with these Nodes continue to work, and you can still edit and clone them as well as export them as a Package. However, you can't create new ones in Cognigy.AI 4.96 or later.
  - AudioCodes Nodes will be removed in Q1 2026. After the removal, AI Agents using these Nodes will stop working properly. We strongly recommend migrating to [Voice Gateway Nodes](/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/voice/voice-gateway/overview) before the removal.
