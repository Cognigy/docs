<Warning>
  With Cognigy.AI 4.91, the Understood Messages concept was deprecated. Use the [Goals and Tasks](https://docs.cognigy.com/ai/analyze/goals-and-tasks/overview/) concepts to evaluate whether your AI Agent understood a particular phrase. In Cognigy.AI 2025.19, the charts related to the `understood` concept were removed from Insights reports.

  Respectively, the `understood` field was also deprecated from the OData endpoint in Cognigy.AI 4.91. In Cognigy.AI 2026.1, the `understood` field was fully removed from the OData endpoint. Use the [Goals collection](https://docs.cognigy.com/ai/analyze/odata#goals) in the Cognigy.AI OData endpoint.

  Refer to the list of all upcoming removals on the [Deprecations and Removals](https://docs.cognigy.com/release-notes/deprecations-and-removals/) page.
