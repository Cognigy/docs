<Warning>
  The Handover Providers section in the Endpoint settings was deprecated in 4.97. From Cognigy.AI 2026.4 on, the Handover Settings section in the Endpoint settings is in read-only mode. You can't use this section to configure new handover providers. You can still view configured handover provider settings, but you can't change them.
  To configure handover providers, use the [Handover Providers](/ai/escalate/migration) interface, which offers greater flexibility for managing your integration with contact centers.
  For a smooth migration, refer to the [migration guide](/ai/escalate/migration).
