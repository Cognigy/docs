  Starting from Cognigy.AI 4.75.0, the `URLToken` parameter is mandatory for the Socket.IO and Webchat Endpoints. This parameter must be included along with `userId` and `sessionId` in the connection parameters. This functionality is automatically handled in `@cognigy/socket-client`, beginning with 4.5.3, and in Webchat v2.36.0. Ensure that you upgrade if you are using earlier versions.
