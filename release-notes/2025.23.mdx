<Warning>
  AudioCodes Nodes will be removed by the end of 2025. After the removal, AI Agents using these Nodes will stop working properly. We strongly recommend migrating to [Voice Gateway Nodes](/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/voice/voice-gateway/overview) before the removal.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  In Cognigy.AI 2025.25.0, transformers will start using the `axios` library for handling HTTP requests internally instead of `request-promise`. This change occurs to improve security and maintainability. The following HTTP request options will still be supported:
  
  - **URL/Endpoint Configuration** — `uri`, `url`  
  - **Request Method** — `method`  
  - **Request Headers & Configuration** — `headers`  
  - **Request Body/Data** — `form`, `json`  
  - **Query Parameters** — `qs`, `qsStringifyOptions`  
  - **Authentication** — `auth`  
  - **Connection & Network** — `proxy`, `maxRedirects`, `gzip`, `encoding`
  
  If you use other HTTP request options, review your transformer code to ensure it is compatible with the new `axios` library before the release of Cognigy.AI 2025.25.0.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  With Cognigy.AI 4.91, the Understood Messages concept was deprecated. Use the [Goals and Tasks](https://docs.cognigy.com/ai/analyze/goals-and-tasks/overview/) concepts to evaluate whether your AI Agent understood a particular phrase. In Cognigy.AI 2025.19, the charts related to this concept were removed from the Insights reports.

  Respectively, the `understood` field was also deprecated from the OData endpoint in Cognigy.AI 4.91. The full removal of the `understood` field from the OData endpoint is scheduled for 2026.1. Use the [Goals collection](https://docs.cognigy.com/ai/analyze/odata#goals) in the Cognigy.AI OData endpoint.

  Refer to the list of all upcoming removals on the [Deprecations and Removals](https://docs.cognigy.com/release-notes/deprecations-and-removals/) page.

## 2025.23.0

### Cognigy.AI

**Released** November 11, 2025

#### Features

##### AI Agent Knowledge Tool

Introduced the knowledge tool for AI Agents. This feature allows you to easily add a knowledge tool to your AI Agent to access Knowledge Sources in the [AI Agent editor](/ai/agents/develop/manage-ai-agents), [AI Agent Node](/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/ai/ai-agent), or [LLM Prompt Node](/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/service/llm-prompt)

#### Improvements

- Added the option to define a custom header to authenticate through [OAuth 2.0 in the Azure OpenAI LLMs](/ai/agents/develop/gen-ai-and-llms/providers/microsoft-azure-openai)
- Added the [GET Latest Log Entries](https://docs.cognigy.com/api-reference/logs-v20/get-latest-log-entries) API endpoint to retrieve Cognigy.AI logs with improved performance. By default, this endpoint has a time window of 2 hours. You can change the time window by setting the `FEATURE_ACTIVE_LOGGING_WITH_TAIL_CUT_OFF_HOURS` environment variable in the Helm chart. However, larger time windows may cause lower performance. If you need to retrieve logs over a very long period of time, for example, all your logs, you can use the [GET LogEntries](https://docs.cognigy.com/api-reference/logs-v20/get-logentries) API endpoint. For better performance, pass the `startDate` and `endDate` parameters to the endpoint.

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where the Question Node didn't recognize email addresses containing the `old` substring
- Fixed the issue where missing or incorrect Intents were displayed in debug messages

Now, the GET methods parameters were changed to `previousCursor` and `nextCursor`, and the `extension` parameter type was changed to `string`
- Fixed the issue where translated text didn't appear after the Locale change
