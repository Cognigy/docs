## 2025.20.2

### Cognigy Voice Gateway

**Released** October 15, 2025

#### Improvements

- Removed the [`CALL_RECONNECTED`](/voice-gateway/references/events/overview) event, which was previously sent to the Flow after a WebSocket reconnection. This change prevents it from registering as user input and causing unintended behavior

## 2025.20.1

### Cognigy.AI

**Released** October 7, 2025

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where certain integrations broke due to reliance on an undocumented property in the `agentReply` message

### Infrastructure

**Released** October 1, 2025

### Cognigy Voice Gateway

- Updated the value in `{{ .Values.jobs.image }}` from `vg-alpine-curl:3.20` to `vg-alpine-k8s-tools:3.22`. This change was done because the image used in the `audit-logs-cleanup` CronJob and in the `audit-cleanup-admin-extractor` Job were no longer accessible in the public [docker.io](https://www.docker.com/) registry

## 2025.20.0

### Cognigy.AI

**Released** September 30, 2025

#### Features

##### Webhook Logging for AI Agent and LLM Prompt Nodes

Introduced the [Send Request Logs to Webhook](/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/ai/ai-agent) option to the Debug Settings in AI Agent and LLM Prompt Nodes. Enabling this option allows developers to capture and forward request logs to a specified webhook endpoint for debugging and monitoring purposes, helping to troubleshoot issues more effectively.

#### Improvements

- Added the [Custom Headers](/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/ai/ai-agent) parameter to the Advanced section in the MCP Tool Node. This parameter allows you to specify any key-value pairs to be added to your MCP connection headers
- Extended the [Textual Description](/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/basic/say) parameter capabilities for the output types: Video, Audio, Image, Adaptive Card, Gallery, and List. For these types, you can now include text from the Textual Description parameter in the prompt or transcript
- Updated the JSON example in the Source Data parameter of the [Fuzzy Search Node](/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/ai/fuzzy-search). This update improves clarity for users when configuring the Node and ensures the example aligns with common practical scenarios
- Added new audit events. Now, Cognigy.AI OData requests are logged as `odataRequest` in the Admin Center for better transparency and monitoring
- Removed the `FEATURE_ENABLE_OAUTH2_AZURE_CONNECTION_WHITELIST` feature flag for the OAuth2 authentication method in the [Azure OpenAI LLM configuration](/ai/agents/develop/gen-ai-and-llms/providers/microsoft-azure-openai)

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where JSON responses weren't parsed correctly when using non-streamed requests to Azure OpenAI
- Fixed the issue where a deleted Project couldn't be removed from global resources
- Fixed the issue where uncollapsed Knowledge Chunks in the Chunk editor were sometimes overlapping
- Fixed the issue where long Knowledge Source titles and descriptions were displayed incorrectly in the Chunk editor
- Fixed the issue when updating an email using the Update Profile Node. Now, the system correctly saves and displays the email in the Contact Profile and the Cognigy.AI OData Endpoint instead of showing it as `undefined`

### Cognigy Voice Gateway

**Released** September 30, 2025

#### Features

##### Advanced RTP Traffic Routing

The Anchor Media parameter is now [Media Path](/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/voice/voice-gateway/transfer), giving enhanced control over RTP routing for monitoring, transcoding, security, and NAT handling. The Full Media and Partial Media options remain compatible with previous settings (On/Off), while No Media allows direct routing without a media platform.

### Cognigy Live Agent

**Released** September 30, 2025

#### Improvements

- Introduced [version 1.1](/live-agent/tools/odata-endpoint) for the Live Agent OData endpoint

### Cognigy Insights

**Released** September 30, 2025

#### Improvements

- Fixed the issue where empty messages containing only timestamps were shown in the Transcript Explorer
