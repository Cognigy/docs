<Warning>
  In Cognigy.AI 2025.25.0, transformers will start using the `axios` library for handling HTTP requests internally instead of `request-promise`. For more details, read [Transformers Overview](/ai/for-developers/transformers/overview).
</Warning>

<Warning>
  The following Anthropic models have been removed from Cognigy.AI because they are no longer supported by Anthropic: `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`, `claude-3-5-sonnet-latest`, `claude-instant-v1`, and `claude-v1-100k`.

  If you use these models in your Flows, replace them with available models from the [Model Support by Feature](/ai/agents/develop/gen-ai-and-llms/model-support-by-feature) list to ensure your AI Agents remain stable.
