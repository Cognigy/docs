### Infrastructure

#### Cognigy.AI + Insights + Agent Copilot + AI Ops Center

##### Activate AI Ops Center

The activation process depends on the installation type:

- **Shared and dedicated SaaS.** All clusters include the Cognigy.AI monitoring stack by default. Contact your Customer Success Manager to activate AI Ops Center.
- **On-Premises.** AI Ops Center is unavailable for on-premises installations. To conserve cluster resources, add the following to the localized `values.yaml` file:

    ```yaml
    dbConnectionString:
      services:
        serviceSentinel:
          enabled: false

    serviceSentinel:
      enabled: false
    ```

#### Voice Gateway

- Enable Redis keep-alive ping. Add a new environment variable to `{{ .Values.cognigyEnv }}` named `REDIS_KEEP_ALIVE_INTERVAL_IN_SECONDS` with a default value of 10 seconds. All services with access to Redis will restart after applying this value.

- [Cognigy.AI, Insights, and Agent Copilot](/ai/administer/installation/version-compatibility-matrix)
