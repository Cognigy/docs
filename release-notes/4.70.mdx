## 4.70.0

### Cognigy.AI

**Released** February 20, 2024

#### Improvements

- Made package uploads more user-friendly by keeping extracted content when navigating during the upload process
- Improved the [LLM Prompt](/ai/agents/develop/node-reference/service/llm-prompt) Node by adding JSON Mode, detailed results storage, stream copy storage, seed parameters, and custom options
- Improved by [forwarding custom attributes](/ai/escalate/handover-reference/genesys-cloud-open-messaging), including queue, languages, skills, and manually defined attributes, into the Genesys inbound message flow.
