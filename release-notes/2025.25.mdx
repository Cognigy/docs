<Warning>
  With this release, transformers starts using the `axios` library for handling HTTP requests internally instead of `request-promise`. For more details, read [Transformers Overview](/ai/for-developers/transformers/overview).
</Warning>

<Warning>
  The following models have been removed from Cognigy.AI because OpenAI and Microsoft Azure OpenAI no longer support them: `gpt-3.5-turbo`, `gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct`, and `gpt-4`.

  If you use these models in your Flows, replace them with available models from the [Model Support by Feature](/ai/agents/develop/gen-ai-and-llms/model-support-by-feature) list to ensure your AI Agents remain stable.
