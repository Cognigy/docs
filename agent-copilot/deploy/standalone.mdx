You can deploy Agent Copilot as a standalone app.

In this mode, Copilot is accessed via a dedicated URL and can be opened on a separate browser tab instead of being embedded into a contact center interface. This option is useful if your contact centter doesn't support embedding, or if human agents prefer working with Agent Copilot in a full-screen view.

All features remain available, including real-time guidance, transcript sharing, and support for both chat and voice use cases.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you configured an Agent Copilot URL using the following pattern: `https://${AgentCopilotBaseUrl}/?userId=${userId}&sessionId=${sessionId}&URLToken=${URLToken}`. For the configuration details, refer to the [Agent Copilot URL](/agent-copilot/configure/overview#agent-copilot-url) section.
2. Pass this URL along with the handover to the human agent.
   - For native integrations, the link is passed automatically.
   - For custom integrations, include the link in your handover configuration.
3. If you work with voice use case, check the Transfer Node in your Flow.
4. Configure the Transfer Node:
    1. Fill in the **Transcription Webhook** field with your Agent Copilot URL.
    2. Activate **Enable Copilot**.
    3. Specify the header that carries the UUIValue in the **Copilot Headers Key** field. The default is `X-Custom-Header`. This header will be sent to the Agent Copilot transcription webhook, while the UUIValue is also forwarded via SIP headers when transferring the call to the human agent.
