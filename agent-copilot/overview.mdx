## Copilot: Standalone or Embedded

You can use the Agent Copilot workspace in two different ways:

- **Standalone application**. When a conversation is handed over to a human agent, they receive a link in the conversation chat that allows them to access the workspace. This workspace opens in a new browser tab.
- **Embedded application**. When a conversation is handed over to a human agent, the workspace is displayed alongside the conversation chat within an iFrame in the existing interface.
